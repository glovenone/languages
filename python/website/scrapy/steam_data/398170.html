									<h1><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/gid/[g:1:11596182]/announcements/detail/591478020304218487">Evochron Legacy Update 1.0308...</a></h1>
									<p>  Version 1.0308 includes the following improvements:<br><br>- 'High + Smoothing' option added to Texture Detail setting in main Options menu (see notes).<br>- Added ability to change single player simulation options and faction affiliation of profiles (added to 'Rename Pilot' option).<br>- Bypass added to Steam cloud save system to prevent a folder error message if security settings/software block the game from being allowed to access the folder.<br>- Experimental VR rendering system converted to OpenVR to support the HTC Vive and other compatible VR devices.<br>- Many HUD, menu, UI, and indicator graphics have been updated for improved appearance in experimental VR system.<br>- Contract link in multiplayer no longer overrides jump point if player's jump drive is already activated.<br>- Top tier civilian frames reduced in assembly caps to accommodate absolute equipment limit.<br><br><br>  Notes:<br><br>  When the Texture Detail option is set to 'High + Smoothing', the game will generate additional surface smoothing details for certain objects in the game including ship frames, ship components, station/city modules, and cockpits.  The generation process will add additional loading time during the initial startup phase of the game.  The benefit is that various surfaces of these objects will appear smoother and rounded for a more detailed look, rather than flatter with sharper angles.  The 'High + Smoothing' setting is also more of an optional mode.  If you prefer objects to have sharper edges and angles, you can use the 'High' mode as the maximum setting and full resolution texture details will still be applied.  If you prefer a smoother and more rounded appearance to various surfaces of objects, then the 'High + Smoothing' mode is available as an option.<br><br>  This update also adds the ability to change the single player simulation options and faction affiliation of any profile.  This way, you can change the game simulation conditions for commodity prices, Econ/Tech, and territory control for existing profiles.  You can also change the single player faction affiliation of any profile.  Keep in mind that if you change the faction affiliation, you will instantly become hostile to the original faction, resulting in being bumped out of a station you may be docked at and immediately attacked.  So before changing a faction, you may want to save your profile out in neutral space or current enemy territory first.<br><br>  For anyone interested in testing the experimental VR mode, be sure to remove any vrsetup.txt file you may have in place for the old system.  The new system uses a different format and list of options for that file (available here: <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.starwraith.com/evochronlegacy/customkit/vrsetup.txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >http://www.starwraith.com/evochronlegacy/customkit/vrsetup.txt</a> ).</p>

									<h2>27 May</h2>
									<h1><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/gid/[g:1:11596182]/announcements/detail/597103984578385332">Evochron Legacy Update 1.0298...</a></h1>
									<p>  Version 1.0298 includes the following improvements:<br><br>- Terrain Walker values doubled.<br>- Option to customize region territory control value indicators on nav map added.<br>- Fleet ships are now much more likely to stay with player if/when they explore deep space.<br>- High energy nebula clouds can now cause the nav subsystem to sustain damage during close lightning strikes.<br>- AI combat systems updated to allow enemy ships to better avoid being baited into attacks from ships flying backwards.<br>- New long range radar equipment item added, supporting detection of generic ship signals out to 20K and 40K (see notes).<br>- Minimum econ/tech level for several advanced equipment items reduced to increase potential availability in Federation space.<br>- The game's device control configuration system is now additionally linked to string descriptions rather than just ID values.<br>- Short range sensor masking capabilities for certain objects now properly active to provide correct benefits of crew and equipment.<br>- 'Technology' nav console button and related text lines renamed to 'Econ/Tech' to match news category title and simulation setting option.<br>- Added ability to right click on any nav map long range sensor blip to set the nav point in the area of a detected signal.<br>- Joystick/gamepad axis controls can now be enabled simultaneously with mouse flight control modes.<br>- Compass displays (both tape and digital) now correctly respond to nav subsystem damage state.<br>- Animal life indicator added to planet details section of system information screen.<br>- Hostile drones reduced to three in last combat training sequence.<br><br><br>  Notes:<br><br>  The game's control input systems are now additionally linked to each device's string description as displayed in Windows, rather than being bound to only a static device ID value.  This should allow the game to adapt to changing controller list conditions if the player plugs in new devices and/or unplugs old ones.  Any device USB port changes need to be made before the game is launched (always be sure to keep the devices you have mapped controls to plugged in before launching the game).  Once the game is launched, it will compare the current device list (as managed by Windows) with the list when the game was last launched.  If it detects differences in the total device count or order of the device string names, it will then analyze the current control bindings for any links between the original device name(s) they were assigned to and any new device names/order.  If the game finds that the device name is in a different list position than it was last time the game was played, the game will automatically apply control map changes so that the original device(s) can continue to be used when it is assigned a different ID value/rank position in the device list.  The game will back up current key/button and axis control bindings before making any changes and will place the keymap8.sw and stickt.sw files in a folder named \ControlSettingsBackup within the save data folder (default is c:\sw3dg\EvochronLegacy).  If you would like to bypass this system and retain locked ID values, simply create a text file in the game's save data folder (default is c:\sw3dg\EvochronLegacy) named stickidmode.txt and in the first line include the word 'enable'.<br><br>  The new long range radar equipment item adds two new range modes to the 3D and 2D radar system.  The LR Radar system supports detecting ship signals out to 20K and 40K.  Details on a ship signal are limited to direction/distance only on the radar and will not provide full telemetry, status, or threat level information.  Ships at long range (beyond full sensor/scanning detail 10K distance) will be displayed as yellow dots on the radar and no target detail information will be available for them.  Ships will still be required to be within 10K range in open space for short range sensors/scanners to retrieve threat, ID, frame class, shield status, hull status, subsystem status, orientation, and velocity information.  When the equipment item is installed, two new 'LR2' (20K) and 'LR4' (40K) modes will be available on the radar, indicating when one of the long range radar modes is active.  The long range radar/sensor system also passively extends the detection range of lost items (which do not broadcast signal data and are well masked from short range sensors) and escape pods by about 50%.  Detection range of hidden/masked cargo containers is also doubled.<br><br>  The new right click option for long range sensors on the nav map will now let you place the nav/jump point marker in the area of a detected signal when using either a deployed sensor station or a sensor probe.  For objects that transmit telemetry data, such as ships and deployed structures, the marker will be placed very close to the object's location.  For objects that do not transmit telemetry data, such as cargo containers and shipwrecks, the marker will be placed in the area of the signal, but not precisely to it.  You'll generally arrive within short range sensor detection of the object, but close range scanning and visual detection will still be useful.  This way, you'll no longer have to try and guess pixel-by-pixel where to plot the nav point to a detected object, the game will now help you plot a nav point close by when using this new right click option.<br><br>  Region territory control indicators on the nav map can now be customized.  Images for green, yellow, red, and purple indicators can be specified for both normal map size and the zoomed map size.  Image sizes are 24X32 for normal and 48X64 for zoomed.  See the customizing kit for more information.<br><br>  To accommodate requests for an increase in challenge from hostile AI ships when the player flies backwards, enemy ships are now allowed to break off an attack and engage other ships when in such situations under certain conditions.  They are also now allowed to engage in at closer range when attacking a player flying backwards to counter attack.<br><br>  Work has begun on transitioning the experimental VR system over to OpenVR/SteamVR in an effort to support a wider array of devices.  I'm not sure when/if this system will become available, but we're in the early stages of the development process and converting things over.<br><br>  The included instructions have also been updated for new options and recent improvements.</p>

							<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Evochron Legacy is a freeform space flight simulation that focuses on 'lone-wolf' survival gameplay and pilot controlled spacecraft management. The environment setting is a vast seamless style universe where you can perform many activities including buying, trading, spying, racing, escorting, delivering, emergency responding, mining, exploring, weapon/equipment crafting, cleaning solar panels, clearing paths through asteroid fields, recruiting, protecting, hiring crew members, fuel harvesting, building stations/cities, and designing/selling ships. Some objectives are part of the game's contract system with established parameters and pay levels while others are available for you to set up on your own terms through your choices of where to go, what to do, and how to do it. <br><br>   Evochron Legacy is a technical flight simulation, not a story or character based game, so you are not limited by plot requirements or pre-selected character roles. You can change the course of gameplay and your role in the game's universe at just about any point. Your decisions and actions define your role in the game and establish your reputation, wealth, progress, and ranking. The emphasis is on real-time tactical gameplay strategy and flight simulation for both combat and non-combat objectives. You are in control of your ship virtually all of the time in open space, including player controlled combat and planetary descents. <br><br>   Your ability to successfully survive dangerous scenarios in space, develop trade strategies, evade detection, harvest resources, efficiently explore for hidden benefits, and transport items can be just as important as your skill in combat. The game also rewards players who devise their own gameplay strategies and 'think outside the box'. Set in a vast explorable universe, Evochron Legacy offers a high level of freeform gameplay with many diverse objectives and paths to choose from.<br><br><strong>Advanced Space Flight Simulation Focused Gameplay</strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Evochron is a tightly focused technical flight 'space-sim' with options and gameplay specifically geared toward that objective.  The game focuses on what flying and managing a spacecraft through sparsely populated systems in a large region of the galaxy as a lone-wolf pilot might be like in the future.  Evochron's focus is on the elements of piloting a spacecraft and the complexities, challenges, and rewards that go along with it while exploring and utilizing a vast 'seamless' style universe.<br><br><strong>Extensive Space Combat Systems and Options</strong><br></li><li> In conjunction with the space flight sim focus is combat.  Evochron is also largely a space combat simulator, so much of its gameplay focuses on that objective as well.  The player is in control of combat related aspects such as heat management, shield array management, energy management, weapon selection spanning three classes, automatic and manual aiming factors, stealth devices, 2D and 3D radar modes, full three rotation axis and three direction axis Newtonian style physics, detailed instrumentation (including six velocity gauges, flight path markers, compass, and pitch ladder), multiple counter measure options, subsystem targeting, target specification scanning, and selecting detailed ship design configurations.<br><br></li><li> The game's display systems have been designed with gunsight focused information presentation in true fighter pilot fashion, including the current target indicator which provides details to the player without them having to look away at a separate display.  As much information as feasible is displayed on the central HUD gunsight and directly on the target being tracked, rather than scattering it all over the screen.  The reason this is done is basically the same as it is for modern jet fighters, keeping the pilot's visual focus in the smallest region possible for the most efficient rate of gathering and processing information.  For example, on the central HUD gunsight, this information is available without the pilot having to look anywhere else across the surface of the screen or on a different display:<br><br>- Forward velocity<br>- Sideways velocity<br>- Vertical velocity<br>- Gravity pull velocity offset<br>- Absolute velocity<br>- Set velocity level<br>- Altitude<br>- Pitch (via traditional ladder)<br>- Heat signature<br>- Weapon tracking status (MDTS)<br>- Weapon firing mode<br>- Target direction indicator (when outside gunsight)<br>- Inertial mode status (IDS)<br>- Forward/reverse/left/right shield array status<br>- Weapon energy level<br>- Hull damage level<br><br>  So all of this relevant information is available within a very tight central viewing angle for the player.  None of this information requires the player to look away at the side of the screen, in a corner, or on a separate display.  This is one of the design goals of Evochron's combat display systems.  In any combat gameplay scenario where the focus is putting a target near the middle of the screen for attacks, it's important to never force the player to have to look away from that focal point to retrieve important information about their flight conditions and ship/weapon status.<br><br>  In addition to information relative to the player's ship, there is also the information provided directly on the targeting indicator of the ship being tracked.  That information is as follows:<br><br>- Target range<br>- Target hull damage level<br>- Target forward velocity<br>- Target absolute velocity<br>- Target forward/reverse/left/right shield array status<br>- Target description<br><br>  Again, this information is provided directly on the HUD targeting indicator for the ship being tracked.  The player doesn't have to look away at a separate display to retrieve this information nor do they have to look at the edge/corner of the screen or on a separate display mode, it's all available right on the current target indicator.  The player can also 'padlock' the target so that their view focuses on this indicator rather than being locked into a forward view only.<br><br>  Evochron's combat systems have been designed to provide the player with diverse control, weapon, energy, and countermeasure options while the game's display systems have been designed to convey a maximum amount of important information with extreme efficiency within the confines of a PC monitor.<br><br><strong>Freeform Gameplay Directed by Player</strong><br></li><li> Evochron is a sandbox game, so in almost every facet of gameplay, the choice is up to you.  The game's intended design is one of a space combat flight simulation first with many individual smaller activities to perform as part of an overall freeform sandbox structure.  The game gives you a framework from which you can develop your own sequence of events based on your choices, performance, interests, and abilities.  Your decisions and abilities define your role in the game and establish your reputation, wealth, progress, and ranking.<br><br><strong>Diverse Gameplay Options</strong><br></li><li> Within the primary space flight simulation framework are numerous gameplay options and activities available to the player.  These include racing, spying, mining, trading, commodity shipping, escorting, combat (both in civilian space and military war zones), exploring (shipwrecks, data drives, discovering new uncharted systems, etc), asteroid clearing, solar equipment cleaning, emergency distress call response, equipment crafting, weapon crafting, crew management, station/city building, and ship designing.  There are many ways to make money and advance in the game within the main context of space flight simulation.<br><br><strong>Make Gameplay Decisions Based on New Advanced Information Systems</strong><br></li><li> Formulate trade, mining, exploration, or combat plans in advance of performing the actions of that plan.  The news console now provides information on quadrant-wide events related to commodity price fluctuations, territory shifts, economic/technology level changes, building operations, and station attack events.  For trade, you can tell where the high demand pricing is at before making the decision to travel to that location to take advantage of it.  For economic level changes, you can tell where an area may offer higher tech equipment or weapons in advance, then make the decision to travel there to explore for those items.  For territory shifts, you can observe when your allied faction is losing ground and needs help to defend their space against the opposing faction.  You can then travel there to help defend your faction's interests and even help rebuild their station/city resources if needed.<br><br></li><li> For mining, a new target scanner system allows a player to scan a targeted asteroid for materials before actually mining it.  And each asteroid can have a unique quantity of materials.  So you can use this new system in conjunction with the news console to formulate an optimal mining plan.<br><br></li><li> The new systems offer an information network designed to keep you informed of the dynamic changing conditions within the game's universe, giving you the data you'll need to make gameplay decisions in real time with the changing events and conditions around you.<br><br><strong>Starting Role and Simulation Options</strong><br></li><li> When creating a profile, you can select which faction you will be allied with in single player and which initial role you want your ship to be optimized for.  The role you select also establishes your starting location, what ship you get, and how many credits you're initially given.  You can choose which elements you want the game to simulate changes for.  Available options for game simulation are commodity, economic/technology, and territory conditions.<br><br><strong>New Quest Menu and Options</strong><br></li><li> New 'quest' menu system lets the player select and activate a single player quest on demand.  Players are no longer bound to one quest at a time, they can manage multiple quests in one menu interface and choose when/where to activate them.  They can also continue from where they leave off in each individual quest.  The new quest system is designed to operate entirely on its own without any contract-based dependencies to offer many new and unique options.  Support for branching structures lets a quest designer include both losing and a winning paths.<br><br><strong>Advanced Seamless Style Universe Structure</strong><br></li><li> A vast universe that lets you fly virtually anywhere without in-game loading screens.  The Evochron universe is not boxed in by 'walls' or 'rooms' that require a jumpgate 'door' to access, there are no required gates or trade lanes to restrict your travel and hold you back.  You can travel virtually anywhere you want.  Descend into planet atmospheres to land at city trade stations, mine valuable materials, or explore for hidden items.  You can escape to nebula clouds for sensor cover or hide in a massive asteroid cave for protection.  Fly from planet to planet, star to star, and solar system to solar system without cut scene or loading screen interruptions.  Explore a consistently interconnected universe.<br><br><strong>Expanded Interactive Training</strong><br></li><li> Expanded interactive training mode with selectable stages to provide the necessary basics for flying your ship, managing its systems, docking/landing, building, and surviving in combat.<br><br><strong>Unified Save Game Architecture and Offline Support</strong><br></li><li> Unified gameplay architecture and profiles let you keep the ship, upgrades, equipment, credits, weapons, crew, and commodities you acquire in the game for use in both single player and multiplayer.  No required online account or login dependencies allows you to play the game entirely offline and keeps your progress stored locally on your own computer for offline access.<br><br><strong>Simplified Faction and Location Based Cooperative Multiplayer</strong><br></li><li> A new two faction system provides a consistent territory and reputation structure across the entire Evochron quadrant.  Players choose the faction they will be allied with, either the Alliance (ALC) or Federation (FDN), in single player when they start a new profile.  The new faction system also lets players select either faction temporarily when they join a multiplayer game.  Faction selection establishes which systems will be friendly to the player and which ones are hostile.  Players can join together with the same faction to team up or join opposing factions for PvP battles and competition.  Territory control is now exclusive to ship destruction, requiring changes to a faction's presence in order to alter a territory control value in a region.<br><br></li><li>Join forces with other players in multiplayer to complete more challenging activities that can offer higher pay.  To link with other players, simply travel to the same sector and have one player accept a contract at a local station or city.  Cooperative multiplayer objectives can pay all linked players.<br><br><strong>New Single Player Fleet Command System</strong><br></li><li> You can now order individual ships in your fleet to form up, attack hostiles, attack your target specifically, mine asteroids, or reload and refuel.  A new 'Fleet Status' option lets you view the damage levels of each ship in your fleet while the new 'Fleet Orders' option lets you view the order each ship is currently following.<br><br><strong>New Planet Terrain System</strong><br></li><li>  The new planetary terrain system features a far greater scale level than in previous Evochron games.  The larger scale and greater detail level allows planets to have diverse terrain features such as canyons and mountain ridges.  Rivers can now include paths that are cut through the terrain surfaces.  The new massive sizes give the player a lot of surface area to work with for the new city building options and to use terrain for cover.  And with additional potential surface objects to discover as well as new related contract objectives, players have more reasons to explore and utilize the surface of planets.<br><br><strong>Ship-to-Ship Options</strong><br></li><li> Direct ship-to-ship trading lets you negotiate trade deals with AI pilots in single player or other human players in multiplayer.  You can trade any items in your cargo bay for an agreed price.  And in multiplayer, you can also exchange fuel pods, send a race challenge, connect as a gun turret operator, and even arrange short term contracts from the trade console.<br><br><strong>New Build and Deploy System</strong><br></li><li> A new build system features a dedicated console menu with a piece-by-piece module construction setup to let players select the shape and placement configuration of the stations they build.  Players can also now build city buildings on the surface of planets as well as stations in open space.  Station/city modules require metal ore to build from that the player must acquire by either mining or purchasing.  Individual station/city modules provide unique functions and benefits including shielding other nearby modules, powering other nearby modules, protecting other nearby modules, expanding inventory/economic conditions, and providing new places to dock for buying, selling, crafting, and storing.  New weapon turrets provide a way to build automated defenses for stations and cities.  All station/city modules are now destructible, so the available trade, docking, and storage conditions of the game's universe can change dramatically over time.  In multiplayer, player built module structures are stored with the server so other players can have access to the new stations/cities and trade routes you create.  Deploy options also use the same build menu and require metal ore to be constructed.<br><br><strong>New Economy and Market Systems</strong><br></li><li> Market prices are no longer limited to slight random variation and can change significantly over time based on simulated supply/demand activities and actions taken by the player.  Both pricing markets and overall economic conditions are divided into 500X500 sector regions and can be tracked via a news console and economy quadrant map.  Continually delivering the same commodity to a location can result in dramatically lowering its value while draining a region of a commodity can result in increasing its value.  Specialized industries still apply to effect local commodity prices and building certain station structures can also effect the local economic conditions.<br><br><strong>Three Installable Weapon Classes</strong><br></li><li> Three weapon classes - beam weapons, particle cannons, and secondary missiles/equipment.  Beam weapons move at the speed of light and do not require target leading.  They are most effective against shields, but mostly reflect off of ship hulls.  Particle cannons fire high energy projectiles at high speed.  They can be effective against both shields and ship hulls, but require leading a target for intercepting.  Missiles are mounted to secondary hardpoints and vary in speed, agility, and yield.<br><br><strong>New Weapon and Defensive Capabilities</strong><br></li><li> Particle cannons now provide about twice the range and have a wider variation of yield levels.  Beam weapons have also had their ranges increased to about double.  The MDTS (Multi-Directional Tracking System) also provides about twice the range to accommodate the longer ranges of cannon weapons.  Shields now protect ships from the kinetic effects of weapon fire.  Missiles are now armored and can take several direct hits from cannon fire before exploding.<br><br><strong>New Equipment Technologies</strong><br></li><li> New equipment items include a repair beam, target scanner, and several secret items that can only be obtained by building in the engineering lab.  The new ship module component option can also expand the capabilities of the player's ship without consuming an equipment hardpoint.  Such options include shield, thruster, energy, ECM, and heat management improvements.<br><br><strong>New Contract Objectives</strong><br></li><li> New and improved contract objectives including local emergency distress calls (including meteor intercepts), animal specimen recovery, retrieve damaged satellites descending into atmospheres, and deploy module placements.<br><br><strong>New Exploration Options</strong><br></li><li> Shipwrecks scattered throughout the game's universe can often provide valuable items and/or information within in their wreckage.  Data drives can be found in open space and on the surface of planets which can contain historical information, clues, and even build templates for equipment items.<br><br><strong>New Models and Textures</strong><br></li><li> All new models for player flyable ships, capital ships, carriers, and station/city structures.  All of which have been designed with a higher level of minimum detail.<br><br><strong>Engineering Lab</strong><br></li><li> Engineering labs can fabricate equipment items from raw materials.  Templates for building items can be obtained from other AI controlled ships or from lost data drives that can be found through exploration.  Several new commodities have been added to accommodate the new crafting options available in the engineering lab.  New commodities include memory chips, batteries, energy emitters, mirrors, radio components, particle accelerators, and lenses.<br><br><strong>Expanded Shipyard and Design Options</strong><br></li><li> Shipyards let you design and customize your ship for the role you want to play.  Optimize your ship for defense, exploration, combat, racing, or transporting... the choice is yours.  You can also position and scale each component to give your ship a unique appearance.  Save your designs with the template system to rebuild it later.  Store ships and cargo in hangars you can access at trade stations.  Expanded design options include the ability to include twice as many cargo bays, new hull material types, adjustable armor thickness, weapon energy resistors, and specialized modules.<br><br><strong>Newtonian Style Flight Model</strong><br></li><li> Realistic zero gravity inertia based 'Newtonian' style flight model including complete 3 axis rotation and 3 axis direction control with optional variable input.  An advanced inertial dampening system helps keep flight control simple in space, atmospheres, and gravity fields.  Physics systems also take into account mass (including additions for cargo), thrust, and vector calculations.<br><br><strong>Interactive and Functional Universe</strong><br></li><li> Realistic environment interaction far beyond the genre's typical 'background wallpaper' or 'view only' approaches.  Nebula clouds, asteroid fields, planet atmospheres, moons, and more all provide unique options for shelter and strategy.  Such environment elements include changes in gravity, fuel consumption, physics, sensor range, and visibility.  When you see a planet come into view, it's an object you can access and land on, rather than just being a wallpaper image or a giant 'space mine' that destroys you if you dare get to close.  And reachable objects in the game's universe are also available without interrupting cut scene transitions or separate 'sharded' modes within the game's universe.  While in their spacecraft, players remain in the same consistent universe whether they are on a planet, in a nebula cloud, in a gas giant, near a star, in an asteroid cave, or in open space.  This means players can chase each other or be chased by AI ships consistently when going from open space to a planet and vice versa in the game's universe.<br><br><strong>Quick Navigation and Inventory Management Access</strong><br></li><li> Quick one-key access to navigation, building, inventory management, and ship-to-ship trading.  No 'walking' requirements to delay buying and selling options or other gameplay activities.  You control all system travel and inventory decisions right from the cockpit or directly linked hangar/lobby menus.  All option/menu transitions are direct without cut scenes or required unrelated gameplay modes.<br><br><strong>New Music by Rich Douglas</strong><br></li><li>  The dynamic music system (with music by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.richdouglas.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  >Rich Douglas</a>) features all new songs composed specifically for the game.  Music changes with the level of hostility from soft ambient to high intensity action.<br><br><strong>Diverse Flight Control Systems and Options</strong><br></li><li> Supports keyboard, mouse, gamepad, and joystick flight control with dedicated modes designed for each input system.  Evochron's Global Control System (GCS) aims to provide consistent control behavior regardless of the input device being used by adapting signals from the selected device to a unified flight control architecture.  Evochron's flight control system also supports up to 10 simultaneous control devices for more advanced HOTAS, rudder, and control panel capabilities.  Use the control device(s) you prefer to play the game.  To learn more about the game's flight control system, visit <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.starwraith.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=11271" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  >this page</a> on the forum.<br><br><strong>Broad Compatibility and Adjustable Performance</strong><br></li><li> Evochron Legacy supports a wide range of system configurations, requiring only a minimum of shader model 3 hardware support, 1 GB of dedicated video memory, 2 GB of available system memory, and a 2.2 GHz processor.  The game has been designed to incorporate impressive special effects and detail levels using minimal resources and low system requirements.  Adjustable detail settings and special effect options allow the player to optimize performance and/or image quality for the performance level of their system.  The game will generally run well on any low to high performance gaming systems built within the last decade or so.<br><br><strong>Track IR Support for 3D Head Tracking</strong><br></li><li> Supports <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.naturalpoint.com/trackir/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  >Natural Point's TrackIR</a> 3D head control system for managing the viewpoint from the cockpit with all six degrees of movement.</li></ul>						</div>

					After having played this game Evochron LEGACY for 33 hours I can say that I could not recommend it. The play itself is slow. The money you can build up is quick if you mine and increase your cargo space so that was ok. Getting from one quadrant to another was just a nightmare deal. The navigation is too complicated. The space docking boring and game play on line with others was none existant.<br><br>I'm sorry but this game needs a complete overhaul. I know it's just one person band and perhaps that is the problem. It's only being seen through one set of eyes.<br><br>I'll just wait for squadron 42 to come out from star citizen.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Im going to make this short and sweet. I really wanted to play this game... It looked like just what I have been looking for in a Space-Sim (Vast worlds to explore, adventuring about discovering things, no stupid story line to get in the way of my adventuring, nice enough graphics to be able to chill to.) But, after buying this game and installing it, litterally NOTHING happened. Well, that's not true... A black screen happened. Over and over and over again. <br><br>I decided to peruse the official forums, I tried every single bit of bug-killing advice I came across over the course of 14 f*cking hours. Nada. I also could not actually join the forum there, as it never sent the email for me to verify my account.<br><br>I uninstalled, I reinstalled, I restarted my computer, I dicked around with my permissions, I even went so far as to shut down my antivirus and firewall. Blank screen staring at me still.<br><br>Desperate, and hoping it was just an issue with the Steam download, I downloaded the offical Demo. Same story. Nothing.<br><br>Now, Im a fairly computer savvy person with a rather impressive set up. I play a LOT of games that eat up memory like candy (Modded Skyrim, Shadow of Mordor, hell even my photo processing software does it.) but I have NEVER come across a game that was so broken that after 14 hours, it still wouldn't play. Im on a ROG with 16 gigs uf usable RAM, and i7 processer, and a danm slick graphics card. <br><br>Im quite disappointed I invested that much time in this game only to be massively let down. even after spending hours following their own bug killing instructions on the official forums.<br><br>Im not even gonna be P*ssed if I don't get a refund, I just want to warn others away before they invest in a game that very well may be broken out of the box.<br><br>Now I have been told that the developer is a &quot;Really Cool Guy.&quot;  and that me being honest about my experiences with this game are somehow unfair to him... well, Im not reviewing his character or coolness, JUST this game. That's a very strange thing to take personally... Im sure he is very nice. But... well, fix your game to run without the end user having to resort to witchcraft, and I will give it another fair shake. Sound fair? Cool.<br>					<div class="gradient"></div>

					I can't recommend this game for anyone but the most die-hard fans of agonizingly complicated space sims. To complete bad tutorial alone you need at least 2-3 hours (refund window lost ofc), and believe me, you will be so frustrated before you finish it. <br><br>The UI is... well, some people described it as &quot;clunky&quot; and &quot;straight from '90s&quot; and it's true.

					If you are into Space flight games, than I Seriously recommend you check out this one! It has a couple flaws here and there but it's one the best Space games i've ever played. The only issue i've had with this game is it can get dull if you aren't very good at making your own adventures. Also it has a fairly steep learning curve so It may be hard for new players to get used to. Overall though it has Plenty of things to do, from fighting in a civil war that actually changes depending on the outcome of your battles, to being a cargo trade ship and just trying to make as many credits as possible. To making your own cities' and Space stations. You can mine, fight, build, adventure, just about anything you can think of. The multiplayer is a bit lacking due to the low number of active players, but with a couple of buddies it can be a really amazing experience, you can fly side by side or they can work as your turret gunner. There are plenty of rare and awesome pieces of equipment like Terrain walkers and Mantis Drives. Great game over all.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					I am 49 years old. I remember when WING COMMANDER pushed the technolog envelope. I built a 386 33mHZ computer so I could play the original DOOM. I am an old time gamer. Having said that, I play BATTLEFIELD 4 and other modern games, mostly on PS4. I am eagerly looking forward to NO MAN'S SKY, and I was looking for something to tide me over until it comes out.<br><br>I say all that because it will explain why I love this game. I tried ELITE DANGEROUS first because I played the original ELITE...way back. I loved it. Very hard but very fun. I tried ED but could not get the sound to work on my Windows 10 computer. I got it to work on my MacBook Pro, but it's 4 years old, and my Windows 10 computer is not even a year old and much better for games. I did not want to be stuck playing on my Mac, but I had 90 minutes to see wha ED was like...and I am impressed with ED's graphics and the whole look of it. I was not impressed but how much grinding would have to be done or how much I would have to pay to keep getting updates for it.<br><br>So then I tried EVOCHRON LEGACY. I have never tried an Evochron game before. I read that it had not as good graphics compared to almost everything else out there, and there was tons to read! Like 100+ pages of tutorial screens just to figure out how to do the basics. The menus are old school. Tons of texts and crazy detailed menus. Not as slick as ED, but  more my style. I like it. I did the training, started the first quest, and have fallen in love with EL. It is a true open sandbox in which you can do anything, and you can fly around a planet or land on a planet. You can even build a station on land or in space! Very cool. I returned ED and am keeping EL.<br><br>UPDATE AFTER 10 HOURS OF PLAY<br>I have a fuel converter. I've done several missions. This game is great if you want a very hard core simulation of flying a realistic space craft. This is not an easy game. I really have no interest in combat. I am playing as an explorer/scientist/spy/smuggler. In summary, this is a space craft simulator just like there are flight simulators. Inertial drive. Coordinate navigation. Limited fuel. Quick death if you jump into something. It's like you are Starlord or Han Solo, for real. I love it. The graphics are not as beautiful as ED, but they are good, and it's more realistic. And it's cheap...you only have to pay for it once, not $60 per year for the half-baked experience of ED.<br><br>UPDATE AFTER 15 HOURS OF PLAY<br>Well, I still recommend it, but it has gotten boring to me. I wanted to be an explorer (like I want to be in NO MAN'S SKY), and I can be, but it is hard and grueling. I keep seeing missions to be a fighter, an escort, to combat ships, but frankly the combat in this game is awful. It is one step up from the old WING COMMANDER. The screen shakes when you get it, and not just a little, but enough it makes the game unplayable. I unloaded all my weapons and just have cargo and items that help me explore, but there are not many missions for someone who does not want to fight. Also exploring is not very rewarding on its own merits. I still have to recommend this because it is worth the money, and I respect the developer for what he he has done. I just wish there were twice as many missions for exploring new worlds so I could ramp up my money and ship faster without fighting. At this point I am not sure I will play again, unless I get the itch so bad between now and August 9 (NO MAN'S SKY) that I cannot resist a little space flight.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Before I start on reviewing Evochron Legacy, I should say that I bought Elite: Dangerous earlier in the year.  It looked and sounded like something I would very much enjoy coming from some old space sims like TIE Fighter back in the day, Rogue Squadron, Rebel Alliance, Star Citizen, and Star Wars Galaxies.  Elite was pretty, but that's about all I could say about it.  It's quests were incredibly buggy, which was disappointing given the fact it's been out awhile.  You may wait forever for an NPC to show up for your quest, maybe they never do, and maybe they warp out soon after you find them with no chance for Interdiction.  Honestly, you do a lot of waiting in Elite.  To make matters worse, the game did not balance well.  Elite would give you quests as a Novice that forced you to face sometimes several NPCs solo, all of which were in better geared ships than you.  I may have been new to the game, but I'm no stranger to space sims, and some of those starter combat quests were impossible.  To sum up my Elite Dangerous experience:  I became incredibly frustrated with the numerous bugged quests that plauged the game and wasted my time, and the combat quests were at times horribly unbalanced.  When the quests DID work, I found myself spending way too much time either waiting on an NPC or searching the far ends of a sector for my NPC to actually appear.<br><br>Fast forward several months and I start hearing about Evochron Legacy from some friends who were also disappointed with Elite Dangerous.  I didn't understand why the two games are compared so often, but having played Evochron I now see why.  They have a lot of the same functions:  space combat, ship customization and upgrading, economy, quests/contracts, planetary landing and vehicles (Free in Evo), and faction control among other similarities.  With Evo I'm not getting the bugs though, everything just seems to work!  The combat is fairly balanced based on my combat level, and if I'm outnumbered I can actually recruit NPC ships into my own Fleet to assist in a contract.  You can destroy hostile space stations and build your own.  The combat is very good and realistically what you would expect with Neutonian style space phsyics.  Best of all, there's not a lot of waiting around!  I never find myself sitting at a POI just waiting for an NPC, when I start a contract I make a jump right to the quest waypoint and begin!  This game is very refreshing.  I'm constantly finding different things to do, whether it's completing contracts, or exploring uncharted space, or setting up a new space station in said uncharted space, or attempting to wrestle control of a region from the enemy faction by destroying their stations and ships, there's plenty to do.  <br><br>If I had one negative thing to say about the game it's that the graphics do look dated, but their are mods you can download to improve the textures and shading, so that point is rather moot.  I've also bought into Star Citizen, and I would much rather have a lightweight game like Evochron Legacy that I can mod up, rather than turn my settings down in the hopes of making a heavy resource game work.  I have a decent system, not something I can run Star Citizen on at max settings, but it runs Evochron just fine.  <br><br>Major Positive Points:<br>+ Diverse contracts/quests without bugs, they just work!<br>+ Great ship and weapon customization, lots of variety<br>+  Not a lot of wasted time.  Unless you're exploring the far reaches of uncharted space, you can make jumps quickly to just about anywhere.<br>+  Good space combat, sound phsyics with the flight model<br>+  Space station/planetary city building, with seamless transitions from space to planets (No loading screens)<br>+  Your actions can positively and negatively affect your faction's control of a sector/quadrant.<br>+  Extremely lightweight install and not a drain on system resources.<br>+  Developer actively reads the forum on the game's website.  He's helpful and actually listens to the player base, something Frontier has not done with Elite.<br><br>Negatives Points:<br>- Dated graphics, but these can be modded to improve your experience.<br>- May be difficult to get into for someone that hasn't done space sims before.  There's a fair number of buttons/controls required, but not more so than other space sims.  There are plenty of tutorials to help explain everything.<br><br><br>That said, I strongly recommend this game if you enjoy space sims, this is a good purchase.  If you're new to space sims make sure you prepare to go through some growing pains while you learn the ropes, but once you learn the controls and how to navigate (Upgrade your Fulcrum jump drive as soon as you can!) this is a very enjoyable game.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					I do not write so many reviews... but.... sometimes I feel that I have to do it and this game is one of those times.<br><br>I don't know where I can start. I want to say that we are living an era where space games are massive... Don't get me wrong,  space games where massive 20 years ago but now we are starting to have seamless space games where you can go wherever you want and now even land on planets... <br><br>There's out there games doing this already...even sandbox games...some of them in alpha state and others in work in progress like star citizen... or games like Elite with the planetary dlc... but this game is so much more than this... it feels real... maybe because the newtonian flight maybe because landing on an a planet is something beautiful.. the planets of this game are gorgeus...massives... there's no loading screen in the landing process...everything happen in real time... your spaceship is also made by frames... and there's a lot frames that you can mix...so there's an infinite amount of combinations that you can have as a player based in which way do you want to play...if you want to play as a trader or pirate or in any other way.<br><br>There's only one thing I can say... if you are a human and you want to see what is out there because you have the human curiosity try this game... is going to blow your mind and right now is the only game that is fully complete with all this seamless freedom.<br><br>Thanks.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					The starwraith boys have been around for a while.  While they had their original games around 2005, I was playing titles like X3.  I stumbled upon this game while browsing XRebirth forums.  Not a fan of XRebirth either, that game sucks too.<br> There is a lot of good about this game, truly.  I would almost recommend it because it is a solid space flight game.  It certainly flies better than XRebirth.  You can also customize your own ship.  The combat isn't too bad, in fact, it is pretty damn good.  You can also fly into planet atmospheres.  The game has a lot of potential, and that's where it ends.<br><br>Like I said, this developer has been making space games for over a decade.  The graphics are about as antiquated as they were in 2005.  The station designs are terrible.  The UI is like something from a 1990's DOS game.  The universe is big, and the exploration can be fun, however, there is a whole lot of absolutely nothing out there.  I realize that's how space is, but even in sectors that should have stuff, they repeat the same clusters of crap over and over, and it is very boring.<br><br>Trade stations are pointless.  The wares don't make sense, they just randomly are there.  Market values are random too, but change when you buy and sell goods at the station you deal with.  Finding components you want on your ship can be challenging too.  It's random that a station will have what you need.  So it can take time for a station to get what you want, or time for you to travel to all stations.<br><br>I'd say something like, the game is in beta, or alpha, or it needs polish, but it is in full release.  It is a complete rebuild of Evochron Mercenary, literally the same universe with changed location coordinates.  I spoke with the developers about getting some leverage in modifying some game elements outside of save files, art, and UI, and it's like pulling teeth.  The radar system in the game is terrible, and the devs want to keep it that way because of game balancing issues and design limitations that would require an overhaul.  <br><br>Like I said, the game has good points to it, like muliplayer and combat.  Flight is interesting, and they just about do it right.  I really felt immersed in that cockpit.  However, the UI, AI, and terrible game universe really ruined immersion for me.  I will hang on to the game just in case it becomes mod friendly in the future.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					After having played this game Evochron LEGACY for 33 hours I can say that I could not recommend it. The play itself is slow. The money you can build up is quick if you mine and increase your cargo space so that was ok. Getting from one quadrant to another was just a nightmare deal. The navigation is too complicated. The space docking boring and game play on line with others was none existant.<br><br>I'm sorry but this game needs a complete overhaul. I know it's just one person band and perhaps that is the problem. It's only being seen through one set of eyes.<br><br>I'll just wait for squadron 42 to come out from star citizen.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					If you like Elite Dangerous but wish you could explore some true unmapped stuff, build your own starbase, or screw around with a dynamic economy that actually responds to your actions, this is a game you need.  Also, private coop with a buddy, run your own server for friends, this is your sandbox right here.   <br><br>It's a one man indie project that has been going on since the DOS days.  This latest version makes massive changes in how things work.  <br><br>You can put bookmarks on the star map, see prices in other regions, have player factions that control systems... A bunch of stuff you can't do in those AAA space games.  Plus the flight model with flight assist off is honest Newtonian.  Oh, and no maximum top speed either.  Are you onboard yet?					<div class="gradient"></div>

					I am 49 years old. I remember when WING COMMANDER pushed the technolog envelope. I built a 386 33mHZ computer so I could play the original DOOM. I am an old time gamer. Having said that, I play BATTLEFIELD 4 and other modern games, mostly on PS4. I am eagerly looking forward to NO MAN'S SKY, and I was looking for something to tide me over until it comes out.<br><br>I say all that because it will explain why I love this game. I tried ELITE DANGEROUS first because I played the original ELITE...way back. I loved it. Very hard but very fun. I tried ED but could not get the sound to work on my Windows 10 computer. I got it to work on my MacBook Pro, but it's 4 years old, and my Windows 10 computer is not even a year old and much better for games. I did not want to be stuck playing on my Mac, but I had 90 minutes to see wha ED was like...and I am impressed with ED's graphics and the whole look of it. I was not impressed but how much grinding would have to be done or how much I would have to pay to keep getting updates for it.<br><br>So then I tried EVOCHRON LEGACY. I have never tried an Evochron game before. I read that it had not as good graphics compared to almost everything else out there, and there was tons to read! Like 100+ pages of tutorial screens just to figure out how to do the basics. The menus are old school. Tons of texts and crazy detailed menus. Not as slick as ED, but  more my style. I like it. I did the training, started the first quest, and have fallen in love with EL. It is a true open sandbox in which you can do anything, and you can fly around a planet or land on a planet. You can even build a station on land or in space! Very cool. I returned ED and am keeping EL.<br><br>UPDATE AFTER 10 HOURS OF PLAY<br>I have a fuel converter. I've done several missions. This game is great if you want a very hard core simulation of flying a realistic space craft. This is not an easy game. I really have no interest in combat. I am playing as an explorer/scientist/spy/smuggler. In summary, this is a space craft simulator just like there are flight simulators. Inertial drive. Coordinate navigation. Limited fuel. Quick death if you jump into something. It's like you are Starlord or Han Solo, for real. I love it. The graphics are not as beautiful as ED, but they are good, and it's more realistic. And it's cheap...you only have to pay for it once, not $60 per year for the half-baked experience of ED.<br><br>UPDATE AFTER 15 HOURS OF PLAY<br>Well, I still recommend it, but it has gotten boring to me. I wanted to be an explorer (like I want to be in NO MAN'S SKY), and I can be, but it is hard and grueling. I keep seeing missions to be a fighter, an escort, to combat ships, but frankly the combat in this game is awful. It is one step up from the old WING COMMANDER. The screen shakes when you get it, and not just a little, but enough it makes the game unplayable. I unloaded all my weapons and just have cargo and items that help me explore, but there are not many missions for someone who does not want to fight. Also exploring is not very rewarding on its own merits. I still have to recommend this because it is worth the money, and I respect the developer for what he he has done. I just wish there were twice as many missions for exploring new worlds so I could ramp up my money and ship faster without fighting. At this point I am not sure I will play again, unless I get the itch so bad between now and August 9 (NO MAN'S SKY) that I cannot resist a little space flight.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					This will be a fairly long review.  I find a couple of line reviews to be of not much use for potential buyers.<br>First off, lets get this out of the way.  If you like Elite Dangerous you are going to either love this game or hate it.  That is because the Elite Dangerous community is torn between the arcade crowd and the sim crowd.  There are the old guard who believe the ED devs can do no wrong and the other camp which will quite loudly point out the worts.  ED is trying to cater to too many gamer types in my opinion and in the end causing a huge divide amongst it's player base.  Also the peer to peer instancing, ability to move from single player to multiplayer at a whim.  Did I mention all the instancing?  Everything is instanced.<br><br>If you love the &quot;Oohh and Aahh&quot; of flying into huge stations spinning in space, you will be disappointed in Evochron.  If you LIKE having things you explore for or targets to shoot magically appear in front of you, then this is not the game for you.  If you have to have cutting edge graphics in your game or total 1to1 universe, this is probably not the game for you.  If you like arcade flight models, magical space brakes and no realistic newtonian physics in outer space, this is probably not the game for you.  If you like having to leave the game to watch videos of how to play the game because the game doesn't give proper instructions (in-game) then this is probably not the game for you.  If you like to have a magical galaxy map with every star system in the galaxy shown to you and all you have to do is take the time to jump to them, this is probably not the game for you.  If exploration simply means jumping from system to system to see what variations of colored balls there are or where the next cool screen shot can be taken, this is probably not the game for you.  I think you get the point.<br><br>If on the other hand, you love feeling like you are in a sim with complex mechanics while flying through space.  You will love this game.  If you  want a smaller  map of the galaxy mapped out for you and you have to find all the rest, this is the game for you.  If you like playing co-op or multiplayer with the ability to host a server, or solo offline with no downtime from server maintenance, this is the game for you.  If exploration means searching for system or items as opposed to having them magically be mapped or appear, you are in the right place.  I could go on and on but here is the simple breakdown:<br><br>Cons:<br>1.  No big spinning space stations to land in.  <br>2. Graphics are not as cutting edge as ED.  (Mods will fix this in the near future for high end systems)<br>3. Galaxy is not billions of stars or true 1to1<br><br>Pros:<br>1. Flight model is incredible and takes time to learn.  You will not be blasting enemies out of the sky your first time out.  You will have to learn how to fight with flight assist off and you will have to learn how to manage thrusters and heat.  There is no arcade mode here.  There is MUCH more to keep tabs on in this game.  You have a proper &quot;Heads up Display&quot; with lots of info to track.<br>2. You can fly through space until you die.  Hit the afterburners and turn off flight assist and you will continue at that speed forever.  No instances.  You will move from sector to sector without ever seeing a loading screen and you never have to jump if you don't want to.  You can land on both atmospheric planets and not atmospheric planets.  There are weather effects and wildlife.  The progression from space to planet is SEAMLESS with no jarring transitions from one flight mode to another or transition screens.  Don't expect to fly from space to the planet surface in a matter of seconds, and you better manage your speed or you will burn up!<br>3.  Space is very atmospheric.  I will not spoil it for you but travelling from system to system or even within one system will change what is arround you.  All of the dangers out there are not just enemy pilots.  You can find things on planets, in space, in asteroid rings etc.  Space is there for you to discover!  You find it, it doesn't find you.<br>4.  You can build space stations and planet stations.  You can build your own ship anyway you like.  You can customize everything on your ship.<br>5.  The economy is dynamic.  You can trade at stations, with NPC ships and even between players.  You can even give other real players contracts to do for you.<br>6.  NPC wing mates.  Yes, you can have wings of NPC's.  Yes I said wings.  Up to 8 I believe.  That is 8 sets of wings.<br>7.  Planets are big, beautiful and nicely detailed. <br>8. The game plays incredibly smooth.  No stutters or bad load in of graphics.<br>9.  Missions are fun!  Have you ever shot meteors hurtling towards a planet in a mission to save a planetary base?<br>10.  Space chatter.  It's nice to hear some voices out there.<br>11.  Ability to scan asteroids for their materials before you mine them. <br>12. Travel on the planet surface in a Mech.  <br>13. Fly through and explore ancient tunnels within huge asteroids. <br>14.  Most importantly - an amazing Dev.  He will update his games for years and has a true moral compass. He is extremely active with the community and will help you personally if you run into an issue.  This guy deserves all the success that could possibly come to him.  His games sell themselves on word of mouth.  VERY loyal community and the official forums on the main site are free of negativity.  Helpful dev and helpful community.<br><br>I could go on but truly, if you love this genre, you will love this game.  There will always be differences between space games and that's ok.  What appeals to some does not appeal to others.  If you are truly on the fence go to the main site and download the free demo with 90 minutes of play time.  I suggest using all of the demo time on the in-game tutorial.  Why?  It's the best way to find out just how deep this game is.  You can always remove the demo and re-download it and your 90 minutes will start again.  Now you can play around and test things out.  No need to worry about steam refunds.  Devs who are confident in their products have DEMOS.  Enjoy!					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Amazing! Everything I love about Evochron Mercenary and more.  You'll feel right at home when you start playing.  By far the best space sim I've played and I've played many.  So much to explore and lots of hidden items.  Multiplayer is awesome and the universe feels alive and not dull.  Many improvements on EM, such as the map system and graphics.<br><br>Also modding is REALLY simple in this game, as was the games before it.  Everything, including a demo is on the website, so check it out.  You can easily mod everything if you want.  Look for a lot of cool mods/additions and 3rd party tools to be released.  The community is great.<br><br>Mechs, I forgot to mention the terrain walkers.  <br><br>Lots of information at the official site including a modding guide, don't like the tractor beam sound?  Simply create/download a new one and drop into the specified directory.  Want to remove mods? Just delete the directories.  Stay tuned, people will create amazing cockpits and hi-res textures for everything.   <br><br>The trade system is really viable now, and prices fluctuate based on actions from players.  There is fighting over territory, economy and technology levels.  Crafting in the engineering lab.  If you want a hardcore space-sim with a great community, strategic attacks and a single-player game that plays just like multiplayer then this is your game.  If you want a pretty grindfest with no substance then you know where to play. <br><br>Don't like the graphics, add your own.  Add your own models, textures, cockpits, HUDS, anything you want, make a total conversion and release it to the community. <br><br>There is a demo, you don't even need to worry about a refund.  Also, check out <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.starwraith.com/evochronlegacy/development.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >http://www.starwraith.com/evochronlegacy/development.htm</a> if you have any doubts about what's changed.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					I have been playing Evochron Mercenary and this, this is EM on steroids... Everything is better, planets have a weather, there is so much improvements in graphics, dynamic economy and territory changes due to the war, this is the true simulator. I own Elite Dangerous and comparing to this one, its just empty, boring shell - even with recent updates... Here you have everything, huge universe, planet landings (You can land everywhere - on every planet), base building - unlimited space ship design (many parts so the look will always be different)... Seriously if you are into space sims - buy it, You will not regret - This man deserves all the money :D. <br><br> There will be some learning to do (space sim stuff - it has newtonian physics implemented), but after u will get it it will suck u into its world. <br><br>Just to mention - previous game was around for few years and people were still discovering interesting things - new planets, systems etc - if this guy will keep adding stuff, improving the game more, maybe some dlc - this game will eat and spit ED and SC.<br><br><br><br>					<div class="gradient"></div>

				<div class="content">
					I had never, ever, heard of any of the past Evorchron titles before.  This game just appeared on the Steam homepage one day in late January 2016, on it's launch day, seemingly out of nowhere, and boy am I grateful it did.  <br><br>It has since sort of disappeared from Steam's homepage, in one short week, and that is kind of tragic.  Not for me, no, but for the people who will love this game to bits and pieces, but never hear about it potentially.  <br><br>$25 get's me virtually everything I've ever wanted out of a sand-box space sim within Evochron Legacy's mere 350MB contents. This is a fully fleshed out and finished space sim. Fully....  <br><br>It kind of boggles my mind, how this game isn't WAY more popular than it currently is, and how the general public hasn't seen it coming.  I'm sort of dumbfounded.        <br><br>Forget about the shameful fleecing and unfinished game that Elite Dangerous is, or the Alpha tech demo arena that Star Citizen is.  At best, neither of those games will be realized as something resembling a finished game for years.  $25 bucks, right now, will grant you access to the fully fleshed out sandbox space sim that is Evochron Legacy.<br><br>This is not a comprehensive list, just something off of the top of my head as a newbie, and in no particular order:<br><br>- Mine, trade, explore, mercenary, straight up combat roles to tackle. <br> <br>- Seamless planetary decent, into an actual dynamic atmosphere, planetary landings, and planetary exploration.<br><br>- Ship construction, space station construction, terrestrial city construction... It's a virtual mini &quot;city builder&quot; game mechanic just waiting for you in game. <br><br>- Terrestrial life forms.<br><br>- An on-going war, bringing hostile zones to avoid or engage in whilst you choose your adventure in this HUGE sandbox.<br><br>- True single player and multi-player options, dynamic affected economy and prices to keep track of and master in either flavor.<br><br>- Customize specialized ships for the tasks and/or missions you wish to tackle, store said ships in hangers.<br><br>- Newtonian physics styled flight in a space vacuum, which is great fun to learn, that changes when entering different atmospheres and gravitational pull.<br><br>-The &quot;simulation&quot; aspect of this game is incredibly deep, and if you just want to fly around ala &quot;EuroTruck Simulator in space,&quot; the price is worth that experience ALONE.  I've spent mad hours just getting a handle of navigation and flying, and I'm probably not even half way there in utilizing all the in flight data and options to the best degree put before me.  <br>  <br>- BOOKMARK the map, and jump to said bookmarks.  Use bookmarks to make notes. (whooooaaaaa) lol<br><br>- Huge Universe!  Is it &quot;1:1 Milkey Way&quot; huge? Nope. But for a sandbox I reckon I'd be lucky to explore half of it in under 1,000 hours of game time just dedicated to exploring, let alone the hours and hours of activities and on going war to participate in whilst trying to explore. <br>   <br>- The community is small, but seemingly everyone in it is there out of a real love for this game, and to help.<br><br>- It's basically developed by ONE person, and he is full time is dedicated to listening and helping sort things out.<br><br>- It's only $25 bucks, and it's an ACTUAL FINISHED GAME.  That's all you pay.  No surprises in the pipeline, just fixes and updates.  Buy it, and get ready to sink crazy hours into what the Evochron Universe has laid out for the nerd in you to do.<br><br>Some minor cons to take into consideration:<br><br>- It's not as pretty as the two &quot;AAA&quot; unfinished space sims out there graphically, BUT it is reported to be EXTREMELY mod friendly.  And mind you, it's ALL here right now to enjoy.<br><br>- Xbox Controller support (Xbox controller, NOT ANY FLIGHT STICK), hasn't exactly been perfected, nor will it likely be.  There seems to be just too many controls needed to be mapped, making it rather pointless. Like I said, the &quot;flight simulation&quot; aspect of this game is really, really deep.  You can't &quot;drop and pickup&quot; your Xbox controller like GTA V or the like, there's just too much going on in the flight simulation.  That being said, mouse+keyboard works very, very well.<br>    <br>- If you are looking for a dumbed down AAA title that you've learned all the mechanics within 30 minutes, and are rocking into the half-way point 8 hours into it, you're going to be disappointed.  This is a pretty hardcore sandbox simulation.  You're going to spend the first 8 hours grasping the mechanics of it all, even more so like myself as a newbie, before even really starting to engage in the Universe.  <br><br>I quite simply cannot recommend Evochron Legacy enough if you are looking for a straight up sandbox space sim, with tons and tons of things to do in it.  Even if you just want to try a space sim, this is the one to try due to it's incredibly fair price, history of support, and the fact that it is so mouse+keyboard friendly at it's core for gameplay.  <br><br>It's abundantly apparent that the person who developed this game has a clear and concise passion for it, and this game deserves to be enjoyed and discovered by many more than are currently playing it.  You simply cannot say that about many games, but I can confidently say this about Evochron Legacy.  <br><br>Cheers people, see ya in space.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Several hours in, and I can already tell this is gonna be a legendary game. It took everything amazing about Mercenary, made it prettier, more streamlined and added even more stuff to do.
