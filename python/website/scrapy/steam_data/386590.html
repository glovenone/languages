								<div id="devnotes_expander">
																			<h1>Why Early Access?</h1>
										&ldquo;Novus Inceptio has been in development, by a small team, since 2014.  Our main goal is the creation of a game for players wishing to help tweak and polish gameplay, as we need feedback if our game is to compete in the modern gaming world. That being the case, this is the reason why weâve decided to go with Early Access instead of a crowdfunding campaign.&rdquo;

										<h1>Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?</h1>
										&ldquo;This will depend on how we polish the Early Access version of the game, or what we like to call the âGHOSTâ version of the game, in preparation for a full MMO experience.  Therefore, due to the complexity of development we cannot promise a specific timeline; however, we currently estimate one to two years of development time.â&rdquo;

										<h1>How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?</h1>
										&ldquo;The game will transition into a full-on MMO.  As such, players will be able to communicate and interact with each other; build houses, villages, and cities together; and, we also plan to add new regions, locations, and crafting.  As each new feature is implemented, players will be notified and be able to download new content.  We have a lot of ideas, so look forward to new updates which we will release periodically!&rdquo;

										<h1>What is the current state of the Early Access version?</h1>
										&ldquo;Currently, the game is in a good state and we are polishing every detail to bring about as smooth an MMO gameplay experience as possible.  The most important features necessary to play the game have been implemented and polished. Game optimization will gradually be carried out according to the feedback and needs of players regarding minimum hardware requirements.<br><br>Current status, you can watch here: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://trello.com/b/7jpJ1NCe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  >Trello Road map/bugs</a>.&rdquo;

										<h1>Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?</h1>
										&ldquo;This is a very hard question to answer at such an early stage in the gameâs development, and, as such, there is no simple answer.  We believe that early access will help to determine the best starting price.  Therefore, price range may alter during development.&rdquo;

										<h1>How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?</h1>
										&ldquo;During the first few weeks or months we will focus on optimization and bug fixing.  After, we will try to listen to all suggestions of the community and polish gameplay based off of the feedback from forums, social networks, the web, etc.<br />
Please understand that it is not always possible to do everything as requested by the community, however, every request will be deeply considered in regards to future versions of the game.  The game, as a whole, should be a result of the work of anyone who wishes to contribute.&rdquo;

							<h2>About This Game</h2>
							<h2 class="bb_tag">Warning!</h2><strong>Game is in early access, before purchasing the game, make sure that you fully understand and agree with its systemâs requirements and are willing to accept flaws/bugs and changes that will occur during its development such as removing all user data. Information below may not be currently fulfilled in this version of the game. Thank you for understanding.</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">PROLOG</h2>Novus Inceptio is a survival sandbox game with elements of MMO. It isnt primarily focused on the destruction of structures, the main objective of the game is to create and maintain shared values. Since the game is currently in early access or in GHOST mode, our goal is to create a proper MMO survival adventure focused on building new civilizations.<br><br>In the GHOST mode, only single player and 64km2 of workable land is available. GHOST mode is a sample of the full MMO and serves as a preview of the interactions, gaming principes, and the mechanics. <br><br>Novus Inceptio is a mix of sci-fi, fantasy and the post apocalyptical world in an unique way. The story is set in distant future on our planet. Earth is no longer how we know it today. Therefore one of the most important topics of the background story is to find out the truth about those who stand behind it all since the beginning...<h2 class="bb_tag">BACKGROUND STORY</h2><br><strong>The dawn of gods</strong><br>Galaxy is a cold and hostile place. Creators know that. They spent billions of years searching for intelligent life and they succeeded. They protect several planets and further developed organisms with advanced technology. Life must not come to an end. Meanwhile, they realize all the risks which await on every civilization such as a destructive genocide. They try to prevent these risks by secretly manipulating and adding information to DNA from foreign forces.<br><br><strong>Rebellious believers</strong><br>Creators stand side by side with the human civilization since its initiation. But no one is perfect. Not even gods. Instead of maintaining peace, humans tend to worship war and forget about their gods. And Creators? They realized that their experiment failed. They could not stop fratricidal madness among humans. When the last envoy was killed, nailed to the cross, they returned back where they came from through a portal. To a different planet? To another reality? No one knows. But what we do know is that they keep collecting information through the portal.<br><br><strong>The end of the world</strong><br>The next step of the human civilization took nearly 2000 years. During this era a nuclear fission was discovered and whole planet became full of atomic explosions. The war was horrifying and efficient. Everyone who did not hide was hit by radiation and killed. From billions of humans, barely a few hundred thousand were left. This scary message was brought to the creators. They were outraged by the human irresponsibility. They came back and erased the whole human race. Â <br><br><strong>Human 2.0</strong><br>The Dead planet kept orbiting in space. During millennia it was slowly getting rid of deadly radiation. The makers decided to begin with a new experiment. With samples of human DNA and surplus of  information they returned life to the planet. They made new humans - Homo Novus. They released them on a newly reconstructed planet and were determined to prevent the same mistakes. Therefore, every clone is now accompanied by a personal robot A2-A.<br><br><strong>DISCOVER WORLDS!</strong><br>A2-A is the guardian angel. It helps and protects people and over time gives them more a complex knowledge. It monitors behavior of its ward to prevent increase in aggression, which caused the demise of the previous civilization. Still, this system is not completely reliable. Creators counted on that. They created anomalies on the new planet, so clones can travel in time and learn from mistakes of past civilizations. And who knows? Anomalies might even transfer them into another dimension. Maybe then, people will devote their time to discovery and knowledge, rather than killing and destroying.<br><br>And the Creators? This time they donât leave the planet, instead they analyze data from thousands of A2-As and wait for the right moment to introduce themselves to their children.<h2 class="bb_tag">MAIN GAMEPLAY FEATURES OF GHOST VERSION</h2><strong>WORLD IS NOT DEAD SCENE</strong><br>We wanted to build an authentic world that is not just a one big scene. Almost everything can be interacted with - from surface, bushes, trees to your own structures. There are no flowers that are mere decoration - do you want grab that mushroom and eat it? Go for it! Even a simple tree does not only provide wood, but also other resources like bark, leaves, branches, resins etc.<br><br>Novus inceptio is world with a natural time flow, daily cycles and weather. Day and night affects wild animals as well and if you stop and listen, you can hear the nature or enjoy the beautiful atmospheric music and relax.<br><br><strong>UNLIMITED POSSIBILITES</strong><br>Novus Inceptio allows a natural creation of the character. Characters will get old and die  from injures, diseases or exhaustion. In this case, players will find themselves in the role of A2-A and using DNA will create a new clone with same attributes. Another possibility in future updates is transferring DNA to offspring, that allows the player to continue if their main character dies. Aging is not affecting  just the player, but also every object in the game. Players will not be able to harvest basic resources or even exchange them for future needs.<br>And why is Novus Inceptio worth playing? Unlike other games, there are no limits on playerâs skills. Players have complete freedom while making their ultimate character. You wont need to think about starting race or role - attributes will be added according to what is your character doing.<br><br><strong>LORE AFFECTING THE GAME</strong><br>Unlike other survival sandbox games Novus Inceptio has its background an lore, which is not only something irelevant. Full story and lore will be revealed over time. This feature opens up new possibilities in upcoming updates.<br><br><strong>ANOMALIES</strong><br>There are many portals to other dimensions and times (new will be added in future updates). Those anomalies cannot be mapped - they are randomly generated for each player. In those anomalies you can find unique reward and mostly learn new recipes. Currently anomalies possess no danger to player, but it is subject to be changed in the future.<br>In new version of Novus Inceptio, you can find those specific anomalies, which are only small hint of what is to come:<br>Procedural dungeons - each dungeons is unique and contains random rewards<br>More dimensions and time periods - desert or winter locations<br>Time flashback - player travels through the time, but stays in the same place. Those anomalies are mainly to learn recipes.<br><br><strong>SURVIVE!</strong><br>In the beginning  the game puts you in the middle of wild and untended nature. With you will only a knife and basic tools. Fortunately, you are not alone! You small personal robot A2-A will be your valuable companion. Nature does not give things for free so you need to find sources of food, heat and prepare for danger, lurking in the deep woods. Also diseases, injuries or even death might knock on your door. Over time you will learn the laws of the world and only then you will be ready for your next trip.<br><br><strong>BUILD!</strong><br>Home is the foundation of survival. You can build your own house, farm and focus on one of the many crafts. The building system works using modular elements where you can plan first and then gather required resources (which, of course, will be a difficult task). The only limiting factors are knowledge of recipes for components, creativity, resources and skill. And of course donât forget to repair damaged or decaying houses.<br><br>You can learn to build new components by exploring anomalies or by buying them in the auction from other players (auctions will be featured in future updates). <br><br><strong>CREATE!</strong><br>Do you like crafting stuff? Then you will love Novus Inceptio. Each and every item in the game is unique and created by the player. Production of any item is a complex process built on many attributes from skill in the art to used material just like in the real world. Crafting system does not tell you how to craft, instead it states what resource is needed - using stone will create stone axe and using iron will produce iron axe - you can even use different materials on every part. For example the durability of the wood is also to be considered.<br><br>Novus Inceptio rewards players for crafting. Item quality and technology will improve over time as well as character attributes.<br><br><strong>EXPLORE!</strong><br>It is not just about the settlement the world, but also about survival and creating a thriving economy. World of life, danger and mystery awaits. There are dense forests, dry desert, vast jungles, underwater life and mountains where you can find different raw materials in an area of 576kmÂ² or 222 square miles (64kmÂ² or 24 square miles in the GHOST version). Novus Inceptio is a long journey of finding valuable materials and truth about the origin of this new planet.<br><br>Investigate the anomalies and find new recipes for crating - anomalies are a way to discover the unknown and expand the gameplay.						</div>

					As of 7/1/2016 - !EXTREMELY! barebones - like tech demo barebones. This isn't EA, this isn't beta, this isn't even alpha. Don't be fooled! - there is no 'game' here at the moment. Is the only requirement to get on Steam these days just that a 'game' starts? This looks like it was made by a couple middleschooler for a computer lab project. Combat doesn't work - there is a reason there are no mobs in the screenshots. Crafting doesnt work unless you assume it is suppose to work without the mats or tools the UI says you need to make things. Even when you harvest things the tools you use (like axes or picks) don't appear in your hands or make sound or well anything. Most of the time I spent trying to get fps &gt; 20. Anything that can be buggy - is buggy.<br><br>Has some possible potential but at the moment avoid it like the plague unless you have bought every other game on Steam. Even then, seriously, go spend the money on an â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. One of the few EA titles I thought was a complete waste of money.					<div class="gradient"></div>

				<div class="content">
					In current state of the game (Alpha 0.08.017) the 5 hours I spent allowed to check most of the possibilities. It reminds me of Banished, another game made by single developer (currently in late Beta), that is really cool and that differs from others, but quite shallow, but there are mods, and I have 64 hours there. Novus Inceptio might have no modding possibilities, but survivor games have another options to keep interest: easy to die (not implemented currenly), grand targets (didn't find any so far).<br>To the point. <br><div class="bb_h1"> Crafting</div>Easy and obvious. You can build a tool made of wood, stone or Iron, so the quality differs depending what parts you choose.<br>There are crafting skills. I cannot confirm, whether they affect crafting speed (that is not a big deal in general), but they affect the probability of success and quality. GOOD NEWS, EVERYONE. If you fail in crafting, your resources are not wasted, but you get skill experience for an attempt. Pretty nice, as for me.<br>For now there are only simple tools (ax, saw, anvil, shovel and some others) and 3 weapons (knife, ax - that are tools at the same time, and a sword). Quality of the tool affects the quality of the product.<br>Tolls may worn out, but first, it happens slowly, and second, repair DOESN'T require resources. I don't expect it to be like that forever, but for now it is so.<br>There are minor crafting bugs. Like, you can normally order a crafting sequence of 10 same parts, but it doesn't work with metal and water buckets as crafting elements. Not a big deal, but still. Or, there is a button that plugs automatically crafting parts in the blueprint, except you cannot order to use the best only parts, it plugs the first worst accessable one.<br>Or, water requirement in the craft when you stand in the water makes no sense. Main hero automatically drinks water by staying in the water source, why cannot it be done for crafts?<br>Overall, this part of the game is good, bugs are insignificant, and  minor fixes would easily fix it.<br>I'd rate it 8/10 and definite potential to have all 9-10/10. <br><div class="bb_h1"> Battle system</div>It is actually poor. You cannot move while attacking or while defending, where exactly the hero strikes is also a mystery. But, while it can be still acceptable, animal AI is weak. I've killed 10 crabs before found out that they can fight back. Animals are ignorant to hits and just run randomly no matter what. Wolves are not a threat as soon as you get shield. Deers are running zig-zag all the time. If Rickon Stark would run like that, Ramsey would never get him. Actually, there is no shooting weapons (and in the final version won't be, probably bows and crossbows maximum, the author wanted to have magical/medieval weapon only). AI is not the top priority right now, but be ready that it is oversimplified (also after 5 minutes of running after the deer it can disappear in front of you, damn).<br>There is a ton of work to do. Battle system is extremely raw, so expect nothing from it. <br>3/10 just because you can fight even with a stick, and crafted weapon differs visually depending on the material. <br><div class="bb_h1"> The World</div>What can I say - it is damn HUGE. 64 km^2, though right now there is no need to move further than 1 km away from the base, but still, it is nice.<br>Resources are located in logical places. Rocks are found in cavities, leaves can be found on the leafy trees, not pines, sand on the shores and... you got it. When you cut the tree with the axe, it falls by the law of physics (more or less, of course).<br>Weather is nice. It rains and shines, night changes the day. The picture is nice, though quite resource demanding, but playable even on not so powerful computers if you adjust settings.<br>There are Anomalies - weird huge cubes floating in the air. When you approach them - you get into one of 4 possible isolated locations that differ from the world you were significantly. Only 2 of them have practical use due to unique resources, but I like the idea. Reminds of STALKER somehow due to the randomness they appear and visual effects when it happens.<br>The World looks and feels pleasant. There is a calendar and temperature data that changes from hour to hour and from day to day. On the other hand, there is no real need to go somewhere far from the initial starting location, and you do not get freeze.<br>Finally, the world is not deterministic, anomalies, trees and some other things change and appear in slightly different places, it decreases boring for sure.<br>Imagining that the same map will be for the online servers, I give 8/10.<br><div class="bb_h1"> Other</div>You can see your main hero chest moving from breathing.<br>No damage from the falling.<br>There is rudimental wound system. For now it only supports bleeding and threatment for it (bandages).<br>There is also evidences of trade system with prices already set.<br><b> Ghost mode </b> isn't actually differ from Single Player (SP), since interactions between players aren't active, but single player doesn't require online connection. These game modes have different accounts, so you cannot transfer your stuff from one to another, so choose one wisely. I am 99% that you WON'T be able to transfer your Ghost account on online server. And actually, is it needed, if this is mostly PvE, not PvP oriented game?<br><b> Crashes </b> happen, but not often. I had two in 5 hours, both in the Anomaly zones. There is something wrong with them, but overall the game is more or less stable with constant auto-saves.<br>I see the big problem so far - hero has no target. Why is he there? What does he want to achieve? After you have a home, armor, weapon, food, is there a way to develop further? I didn't find the answer. While it is an RPG where skills develop as you use them, there is no need to master them more than minimum needed. All of this can be solved by some simple introduction (e.g. NPC with quests) and, say, very expensive to craft teleportation device as the map is huge. But then, map should have places worth visiting. Are there such? - donna know.<br><div class="bb_h1"> Conclusion</div>I will definitely follow the game from time to time, checking improvements. Online is planned  on 2017:Q1. Hope it won't be too raw at that moment. Seems like updates are coming in a good tempo right now, and author gives backward response, that is nice. <br>There are too many unknowns in the future, but I would estimate the potential of the game as 8/10. Sufficiently good for an early access.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					<div class="bb_h1"> Novus Inceptio </div><br>DISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing.<br><br>Novus Inceptio is a crafting, and survival game. It reminds me a bit of &quot;Life is Feudal&quot; or other games of that nature. The interesting thing about this game is that your character, as well as the world, can age. I've read somewhere than when you die you come back as a clone, though in future updates, you could play as your offspring if you get to that stage of the game. Your character is always accompanied by a robot (A2-A) that is supposed to log data as well as help you survive. The game has a unique background story as well as setting. The game plans on one day becoming an MMO and their &quot;GHOST mode&quot; within the game shows how the MMO mode would work. <br><br>The world is dynamic. Changes you make (or other players make) will affect the world. Even the game's lore shapes the world. Items you create in game, can be your own unique version, as there are many different ways, and combinations to make the <i>same</i> item.<br><br>--------<br><br><b> Graphics: 8 / 10 </b> <br><br>The graphics are pretty nice. The terrain look good and although improvements can be made to some of the 3D models, the grass, trees, mountains, rocks, and most of the other environmental visuals look great. The animation quality is good in some places, but a little bit weaker in others, specifically the character and animal animations. It's not as smooth as say the leaves and grass blowing in the wind, though it's a very minor gripe. I have a mid-tier card. I tried running the game on ultra, but the performance was a tad slower than I'd like, so I brought it done to medium settings, which worked fine. You'll have to play around with the settings to match your card and CPU, though I'm sure low tier cards can run the game on the lowest settings. It's great that the game provides you with custom video settings.<br><br>I did experience a few glitches, such as my mouse disappearing and not being able to hit some targets in combat. Though the game mentions that there are some bugs, and even lists a few of them that are being worked on. As it's in early access, optimization and dealing with the glitches and bugs will progress until full release.<br><br>--------<br><br><b> Sound: 8 / 10 </b><br><br>The sound assets were nice. You could hear birds chirping (which was kinda peaceful), your character movements, and sounds from the environment/terrain. It wasn't annoying or repetitive and the audio meshes well with the setting. I don't really remember if there was background music, though if there was, it must have not been something distracting or bothersome. <br><br>--------<br><br><b> Mechanics: 8 / 10 </b><br><br>The game is still in early access but there is still more to come. As in most games of this genre; you can build, craft, explore and survive. You can make many different tools that can perform different tasks, and you also need certain tools in order to craft other items. You have some skills in the beginning such as foraging and cultivating, and you can even cook. The game's mechanics are currently very solid and there is lots to do; from base-building to farming. The combat is decent, though I mainly fought with my starting knife, as that's all I really had at the time. I assume combat is better with better equipment. You can of course arm yourself with different types of armor, clothing and weapons. <br><br>The only thing I feel needs some work is the game's difficulty. There isn't currently much of a challenge to the game aside from trying not to die from hunger and thirst. The animals aren't really that aggressive, and you're never in immediate danger. I know it's something that will probably be changed before the full release of the game. There's also an interface that shows you the weather, time, and temperature, though it's not really relevant at this point in the game. <br><br>--------<br><br><b> Final Personal Remarks: </b><br><br>I'm excited. When this game is complete, it's something I'll definitely take a look at again, and probably be addicted too. These are the kind of games I enjoy. Right now, I can't see myself playing it in it's current state, and I don't really find a challenge in it. Though it does look very promising. With some optimization and some more content added, the game could be the next big survival game. <br><br>Thanks to the devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					<div class="bb_h1">Introduction</div>Developed and published by McMagic Productions, Novus Inceptio (âNew Beginningâ in Latin) is an Early Access diamond in the rough. The game is planned as full-on MMO once it is completed but even for now, the Single Player experience is quite enjoyable.<br> <br><div class="bb_h1">Gameplay</div>Novus Inceptio features a large area to explore and futher develop. The gameâs story has post-apocalyptic tones to it and it can surely be fleshed out even more in subsequent updates. In SP mode (also referred to as âGHOSTâ version) you find yourself with all the necessary tools to harvest, gather and build within the game world. A complex and fully functional crafting system that proves the dev teamâs skill and further potential. It doesnât contain too many in-game threats to your survival as you take relative little damage from the few enemies (mostly wildlife) present. This has to change, as weapons and fighting are as integral to surviving as the crafting tools are. A tutorial would be more than welcomed too as not all would-be players have sufficient crafting experience from similar titles.<br> <br>From a graphical perspective, Novus is truly gorgeous. Despite using Unity Engine, the open world is filled with details, clearly showing the gameâs two-year developent time and overall efforts into ironing out glitches. There are still some bugs here and there but as far as I could tell, none that may be game-breaking. Novus Inceptio has built-in weather pattern changes which along the day/night cycle, really offer a both beautiful and diverse scenery to explore and manipulate at will.<br> <br>The sound department needs more attention but it certainly isnât lackluster even in this Early Access version. Some voice acting would be apreciated too.<br> <br><div class="bb_h1">Pros</div>+ Gorgeous graphics<br>+ Complex crafting system<br>+ Steam Trading Cards &amp; Achievements<br> <br><div class="bb_h1">Cons</div>- Still in Early Access (and consequently, no MP option)<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Result / Final thoughts</div>What really impressed me about Novus Inceptio is how well simulated the inevitability of death is. You age (if diseases donât shorten your lifespan prematurely) within the game and pass on what you have built to your offspring. That really motivates players to never stop seeking out areas with better shelter and resource pools. This is not meant to be a static game afterall and I do believe it can be continuously improved but I fear that once it reaches its MMO objective, survival will be less about witty crafting and more about defeating other human players that only care for combat. Countless films and games have proved that peaceful coexistence in a post-apocalyptic setting is just a pipe dream...<br><br><b>Rating 9/10</b><br> <br><blockquote class="bb_blockquote">This review was submitted for <a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/elitegives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >Elite Giveaways</a>, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles.</blockquote>					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Despite only playing this on my account for little time, i've played this game on a friends account around day 1 of release. <br><br>So far, It's very promising. And what's already there to offer will keep you very busy and you'll have loads of fun. <br>It does have a learning curve, as does any game of this genre, but its easy and enjoyable. Crafting is great, building is better! The environment is where this game wins the most. The developer did something most dont. They put effort and attention into immersion. Every detail, despite random gen, it's amazing! Sure it needs work, but at this point it's better along than most games in alpha stage. It's almost as if it were beta at this point. <br><br>Bottom line.<br>It's a great game, so much more to be added, did i mention it will also support multilpayer later? <br>You couldn't get a better game of this genre today. Buy it, you won't go wrong!<br><br>					<div class="gradient"></div>

					<table class="bb_table"><tr><th>I would like to thank <u>McMagic Productions</u> for giving me the chance to try this game and write out a review for them. However, I assure you their action does not affect my evaluation at all.</th></tr></table><br><b><div class="bb_h1"><u>REVIEW</u></div></b><br><br>A game that has a lot of promises, seems familiar, right? The game doesnât really set any particular goals other than trying to survive or build you a home. It has been said by the developers that they intend to turn this game into a MMO. Along with it is the element of RPG and a crafting system that could really stand out among the rest.<br><br>Even though some parts of the game are already done, I personally think this game is quite far from the complete stage. There are still lots of bugs to fix, content to add, and gameplay to be simplified. Do I recommend this game? Sure why not, but only in few instances. With its current stage, the developers need all the help they can get. <br><br><b><div class="bb_h1"><u>PROS</u></div></b><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Ghost Mode</b> âThis is a unique game mode, probably unique to most survival/crafting game out there. It is basically the same with the MMO but you get to keep whatever you build and crafted onto the MMO mode. And I think is a great start for those who are fairly new to this game, it allows them to have a chance of surviving. <br></li><li><b>Crafting</b> â What this game brings to the table in terms of crafting is quite unique among some survival/crafting games out there. Other than the terrain and the natural resources around, everything else has to be crafted by you. And each is crafted in a detailed manner, they require logical materials to create and not just random things you can find lying on the ground which adds to its realism. <br></li><li><b>Amazing Graphics</b> â What you see in the screenshots are exactly what you can see in-game <i>if and only if</i> you have an atleast above average PC. And if you do, youâll find your surroundings very charming. But sadly if you donât, the graphics would too far from what you have seen.</li></ul><br><b><div class="bb_h1"><u>CONS</u></div></b><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Made With Unity</b> â I want everyone to take note of this, not all users have an average build. And if you do, please stay away from this game. The game will punish you for having a weak PC or laptop. <br></li><li><b>Too Much Promises</b> â For a game like this, the developers needs a lot of dedication to finish this one out. And I honestly hope that this game doesnât end up in the same fate of most Early Access games here in Steam who have lost sight of their goals. <br></li><li><b>Lacks Tutorial</b> â I find it very hard to start out in this game. And I wish they could make things simpler, not show you unnecessary wall of texts. So I highly suggest that you look up some wikis right away. </li></ul>					<div class="gradient"></div>

					I really can't understand why people like this absolute garbage. The graphics look like absolute shÃ®t, even on the highest graphical settings, the framerate is even worse than Arkham Knight and AC Unity were at the time of their release, and the so-called &quot;in-game help&quot; is an absolute JOKE!<br><br>Seriously. I wish I could be Ã¤rsed to explain what is bad about this game, but honestly, when I think about that question I can only say one thing: EVERYTHING.<br><br>The concept is the ONLY good thing about this game, but hell, you can say about almost ANY game EVER made. Simply put, I would recommend EVERYONE to stay as FAR away from this game as you can. If you get it for free, go ahead and waste some time with it, but for the love of everything with a sense of quality, DO NOT BUY IT. The so-called &quot;developers&quot; do NOT deserve money for this extremely poor product! 0.5/10					<div class="gradient"></div>

					The game is quite buggy and underchallenging at the moment  but it's somewhat expected from an early access game. Shows great promise though and the devs have a very active presence in the community and are regularly updating it which makes me quite optimistic for its future!

					<div class="bb_h1">Introduction</div>Developed and published by McMagic Productions, Novus Inceptio (âNew Beginningâ in Latin) is an Early Access diamond in the rough. The game is planned as full-on MMO once it is completed but even for now, the Single Player experience is quite enjoyable.<br> <br><div class="bb_h1">Gameplay</div>Novus Inceptio features a large area to explore and futher develop. The gameâs story has post-apocalyptic tones to it and it can surely be fleshed out even more in subsequent updates. In SP mode (also referred to as âGHOSTâ version) you find yourself with all the necessary tools to harvest, gather and build within the game world. A complex and fully functional crafting system that proves the dev teamâs skill and further potential. It doesnât contain too many in-game threats to your survival as you take relative little damage from the few enemies (mostly wildlife) present. This has to change, as weapons and fighting are as integral to surviving as the crafting tools are. A tutorial would be more than welcomed too as not all would-be players have sufficient crafting experience from similar titles.<br> <br>From a graphical perspective, Novus is truly gorgeous. Despite using Unity Engine, the open world is filled with details, clearly showing the gameâs two-year developent time and overall efforts into ironing out glitches. There are still some bugs here and there but as far as I could tell, none that may be game-breaking. Novus Inceptio has built-in weather pattern changes which along the day/night cycle, really offer a both beautiful and diverse scenery to explore and manipulate at will.<br> <br>The sound department needs more attention but it certainly isnât lackluster even in this Early Access version. Some voice acting would be apreciated too.<br> <br><div class="bb_h1">Pros</div>+ Gorgeous graphics<br>+ Complex crafting system<br>+ Steam Trading Cards &amp; Achievements<br> <br><div class="bb_h1">Cons</div>- Still in Early Access (and consequently, no MP option)<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Result / Final thoughts</div>What really impressed me about Novus Inceptio is how well simulated the inevitability of death is. You age (if diseases donât shorten your lifespan prematurely) within the game and pass on what you have built to your offspring. That really motivates players to never stop seeking out areas with better shelter and resource pools. This is not meant to be a static game afterall and I do believe it can be continuously improved but I fear that once it reaches its MMO objective, survival will be less about witty crafting and more about defeating other human players that only care for combat. Countless films and games have proved that peaceful coexistence in a post-apocalyptic setting is just a pipe dream...<br><br><b>Rating 9/10</b><br> <br><blockquote class="bb_blockquote">This review was submitted for <a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/elitegives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >Elite Giveaways</a>, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles.</blockquote>					<div class="gradient"></div>

				<div class="content">
					<div class="bb_h1"> Novus Inceptio </div><br>DISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing.<br><br>Novus Inceptio is a crafting, and survival game. It reminds me a bit of &quot;Life is Feudal&quot; or other games of that nature. The interesting thing about this game is that your character, as well as the world, can age. I've read somewhere than when you die you come back as a clone, though in future updates, you could play as your offspring if you get to that stage of the game. Your character is always accompanied by a robot (A2-A) that is supposed to log data as well as help you survive. The game has a unique background story as well as setting. The game plans on one day becoming an MMO and their &quot;GHOST mode&quot; within the game shows how the MMO mode would work. <br><br>The world is dynamic. Changes you make (or other players make) will affect the world. Even the game's lore shapes the world. Items you create in game, can be your own unique version, as there are many different ways, and combinations to make the <i>same</i> item.<br><br>--------<br><br><b> Graphics: 8 / 10 </b> <br><br>The graphics are pretty nice. The terrain look good and although improvements can be made to some of the 3D models, the grass, trees, mountains, rocks, and most of the other environmental visuals look great. The animation quality is good in some places, but a little bit weaker in others, specifically the character and animal animations. It's not as smooth as say the leaves and grass blowing in the wind, though it's a very minor gripe. I have a mid-tier card. I tried running the game on ultra, but the performance was a tad slower than I'd like, so I brought it done to medium settings, which worked fine. You'll have to play around with the settings to match your card and CPU, though I'm sure low tier cards can run the game on the lowest settings. It's great that the game provides you with custom video settings.<br><br>I did experience a few glitches, such as my mouse disappearing and not being able to hit some targets in combat. Though the game mentions that there are some bugs, and even lists a few of them that are being worked on. As it's in early access, optimization and dealing with the glitches and bugs will progress until full release.<br><br>--------<br><br><b> Sound: 8 / 10 </b><br><br>The sound assets were nice. You could hear birds chirping (which was kinda peaceful), your character movements, and sounds from the environment/terrain. It wasn't annoying or repetitive and the audio meshes well with the setting. I don't really remember if there was background music, though if there was, it must have not been something distracting or bothersome. <br><br>--------<br><br><b> Mechanics: 8 / 10 </b><br><br>The game is still in early access but there is still more to come. As in most games of this genre; you can build, craft, explore and survive. You can make many different tools that can perform different tasks, and you also need certain tools in order to craft other items. You have some skills in the beginning such as foraging and cultivating, and you can even cook. The game's mechanics are currently very solid and there is lots to do; from base-building to farming. The combat is decent, though I mainly fought with my starting knife, as that's all I really had at the time. I assume combat is better with better equipment. You can of course arm yourself with different types of armor, clothing and weapons. <br><br>The only thing I feel needs some work is the game's difficulty. There isn't currently much of a challenge to the game aside from trying not to die from hunger and thirst. The animals aren't really that aggressive, and you're never in immediate danger. I know it's something that will probably be changed before the full release of the game. There's also an interface that shows you the weather, time, and temperature, though it's not really relevant at this point in the game. <br><br>--------<br><br><b> Final Personal Remarks: </b><br><br>I'm excited. When this game is complete, it's something I'll definitely take a look at again, and probably be addicted too. These are the kind of games I enjoy. Right now, I can't see myself playing it in it's current state, and I don't really find a challenge in it. Though it does look very promising. With some optimization and some more content added, the game could be the next big survival game. <br><br>Thanks to the devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					In current state of the game (Alpha 0.08.017) the 5 hours I spent allowed to check most of the possibilities. It reminds me of Banished, another game made by single developer (currently in late Beta), that is really cool and that differs from others, but quite shallow, but there are mods, and I have 64 hours there. Novus Inceptio might have no modding possibilities, but survivor games have another options to keep interest: easy to die (not implemented currenly), grand targets (didn't find any so far).<br>To the point. <br><div class="bb_h1"> Crafting</div>Easy and obvious. You can build a tool made of wood, stone or Iron, so the quality differs depending what parts you choose.<br>There are crafting skills. I cannot confirm, whether they affect crafting speed (that is not a big deal in general), but they affect the probability of success and quality. GOOD NEWS, EVERYONE. If you fail in crafting, your resources are not wasted, but you get skill experience for an attempt. Pretty nice, as for me.<br>For now there are only simple tools (ax, saw, anvil, shovel and some others) and 3 weapons (knife, ax - that are tools at the same time, and a sword). Quality of the tool affects the quality of the product.<br>Tolls may worn out, but first, it happens slowly, and second, repair DOESN'T require resources. I don't expect it to be like that forever, but for now it is so.<br>There are minor crafting bugs. Like, you can normally order a crafting sequence of 10 same parts, but it doesn't work with metal and water buckets as crafting elements. Not a big deal, but still. Or, there is a button that plugs automatically crafting parts in the blueprint, except you cannot order to use the best only parts, it plugs the first worst accessable one.<br>Or, water requirement in the craft when you stand in the water makes no sense. Main hero automatically drinks water by staying in the water source, why cannot it be done for crafts?<br>Overall, this part of the game is good, bugs are insignificant, and  minor fixes would easily fix it.<br>I'd rate it 8/10 and definite potential to have all 9-10/10. <br><div class="bb_h1"> Battle system</div>It is actually poor. You cannot move while attacking or while defending, where exactly the hero strikes is also a mystery. But, while it can be still acceptable, animal AI is weak. I've killed 10 crabs before found out that they can fight back. Animals are ignorant to hits and just run randomly no matter what. Wolves are not a threat as soon as you get shield. Deers are running zig-zag all the time. If Rickon Stark would run like that, Ramsey would never get him. Actually, there is no shooting weapons (and in the final version won't be, probably bows and crossbows maximum, the author wanted to have magical/medieval weapon only). AI is not the top priority right now, but be ready that it is oversimplified (also after 5 minutes of running after the deer it can disappear in front of you, damn).<br>There is a ton of work to do. Battle system is extremely raw, so expect nothing from it. <br>3/10 just because you can fight even with a stick, and crafted weapon differs visually depending on the material. <br><div class="bb_h1"> The World</div>What can I say - it is damn HUGE. 64 km^2, though right now there is no need to move further than 1 km away from the base, but still, it is nice.<br>Resources are located in logical places. Rocks are found in cavities, leaves can be found on the leafy trees, not pines, sand on the shores and... you got it. When you cut the tree with the axe, it falls by the law of physics (more or less, of course).<br>Weather is nice. It rains and shines, night changes the day. The picture is nice, though quite resource demanding, but playable even on not so powerful computers if you adjust settings.<br>There are Anomalies - weird huge cubes floating in the air. When you approach them - you get into one of 4 possible isolated locations that differ from the world you were significantly. Only 2 of them have practical use due to unique resources, but I like the idea. Reminds of STALKER somehow due to the randomness they appear and visual effects when it happens.<br>The World looks and feels pleasant. There is a calendar and temperature data that changes from hour to hour and from day to day. On the other hand, there is no real need to go somewhere far from the initial starting location, and you do not get freeze.<br>Finally, the world is not deterministic, anomalies, trees and some other things change and appear in slightly different places, it decreases boring for sure.<br>Imagining that the same map will be for the online servers, I give 8/10.<br><div class="bb_h1"> Other</div>You can see your main hero chest moving from breathing.<br>No damage from the falling.<br>There is rudimental wound system. For now it only supports bleeding and threatment for it (bandages).<br>There is also evidences of trade system with prices already set.<br><b> Ghost mode </b> isn't actually differ from Single Player (SP), since interactions between players aren't active, but single player doesn't require online connection. These game modes have different accounts, so you cannot transfer your stuff from one to another, so choose one wisely. I am 99% that you WON'T be able to transfer your Ghost account on online server. And actually, is it needed, if this is mostly PvE, not PvP oriented game?<br><b> Crashes </b> happen, but not often. I had two in 5 hours, both in the Anomaly zones. There is something wrong with them, but overall the game is more or less stable with constant auto-saves.<br>I see the big problem so far - hero has no target. Why is he there? What does he want to achieve? After you have a home, armor, weapon, food, is there a way to develop further? I didn't find the answer. While it is an RPG where skills develop as you use them, there is no need to master them more than minimum needed. All of this can be solved by some simple introduction (e.g. NPC with quests) and, say, very expensive to craft teleportation device as the map is huge. But then, map should have places worth visiting. Are there such? - donna know.<br><div class="bb_h1"> Conclusion</div>I will definitely follow the game from time to time, checking improvements. Online is planned  on 2017:Q1. Hope it won't be too raw at that moment. Seems like updates are coming in a good tempo right now, and author gives backward response, that is nice. <br>There are too many unknowns in the future, but I would estimate the potential of the game as 8/10. Sufficiently good for an early access.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					As of 7/1/2016 - !EXTREMELY! barebones - like tech demo barebones. This isn't EA, this isn't beta, this isn't even alpha. Don't be fooled! - there is no 'game' here at the moment. Is the only requirement to get on Steam these days just that a 'game' starts? This looks like it was made by a couple middleschooler for a computer lab project. Combat doesn't work - there is a reason there are no mobs in the screenshots. Crafting doesnt work unless you assume it is suppose to work without the mats or tools the UI says you need to make things. Even when you harvest things the tools you use (like axes or picks) don't appear in your hands or make sound or well anything. Most of the time I spent trying to get fps &gt; 20. Anything that can be buggy - is buggy.<br><br>Has some possible potential but at the moment avoid it like the plague unless you have bought every other game on Steam. Even then, seriously, go spend the money on an â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. One of the few EA titles I thought was a complete waste of money.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					<table class="bb_table"><tr><th>I would like to thank <u>McMagic Productions</u> for giving me the chance to try this game and write out a review for them. However, I assure you their action does not affect my evaluation at all.</th></tr></table><br><b><div class="bb_h1"><u>REVIEW</u></div></b><br><br>A game that has a lot of promises, seems familiar, right? The game doesnât really set any particular goals other than trying to survive or build you a home. It has been said by the developers that they intend to turn this game into a MMO. Along with it is the element of RPG and a crafting system that could really stand out among the rest.<br><br>Even though some parts of the game are already done, I personally think this game is quite far from the complete stage. There are still lots of bugs to fix, content to add, and gameplay to be simplified. Do I recommend this game? Sure why not, but only in few instances. With its current stage, the developers need all the help they can get. <br><br><b><div class="bb_h1"><u>PROS</u></div></b><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Ghost Mode</b> âThis is a unique game mode, probably unique to most survival/crafting game out there. It is basically the same with the MMO but you get to keep whatever you build and crafted onto the MMO mode. And I think is a great start for those who are fairly new to this game, it allows them to have a chance of surviving. <br></li><li><b>Crafting</b> â What this game brings to the table in terms of crafting is quite unique among some survival/crafting games out there. Other than the terrain and the natural resources around, everything else has to be crafted by you. And each is crafted in a detailed manner, they require logical materials to create and not just random things you can find lying on the ground which adds to its realism. <br></li><li><b>Amazing Graphics</b> â What you see in the screenshots are exactly what you can see in-game <i>if and only if</i> you have an atleast above average PC. And if you do, youâll find your surroundings very charming. But sadly if you donât, the graphics would too far from what you have seen.</li></ul><br><b><div class="bb_h1"><u>CONS</u></div></b><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Made With Unity</b> â I want everyone to take note of this, not all users have an average build. And if you do, please stay away from this game. The game will punish you for having a weak PC or laptop. <br></li><li><b>Too Much Promises</b> â For a game like this, the developers needs a lot of dedication to finish this one out. And I honestly hope that this game doesnât end up in the same fate of most Early Access games here in Steam who have lost sight of their goals. <br></li><li><b>Lacks Tutorial</b> â I find it very hard to start out in this game. And I wish they could make things simpler, not show you unnecessary wall of texts. So I highly suggest that you look up some wikis right away. </li></ul>					<div class="gradient"></div>

					[Early Access Review]<br>What a surprise this was. <br>While certainly there were early access 'annoyances' such as not being able to make a female avatar and a few odd translations, I must say I'm quite impressed with where this game is so far.<br><br>Graphics / UI<br>Are quite pretty and smooth, day/night transitions are realistic and the ambience and lighting is superb, particularly when approaching an anomaly and its glow illuminates the nearby landscape.  Animations are smooth, if a bit simple at this stage, and there was minimal glitchy/laggy experience with the graphics.  There are certain places where if you pitch the camera all the way forward, you can see 'beneath' the ground, but overall nothing that really interfered with gameplay.  The UI is smooth, responsive, and crisp looking with good functionality and is pretty intuitive the way it is laid out.  Hotkeys aren't tooltipped anywhere but with a bit of fiddling you work out that C is for character and I is for inventory, etc.  Overall very impressed with the level of polish.<br><br>Sound<br>The background/music ambience fits very well, and is engaging and immersing.<br>There seem to be some missing sound effects for things like mining, chopping trees, etc. but not really unexpected for an early access / alpha state.<br><br>Gameplay<br><br>Well, as it stands now, its a crafter/hoarder's paradise. While yes your character's inventory is limited, your trusted floating robot ball thing can carry whatever it likes, and it is easy to switch between the two.   You can happily forage/chop/mine and 'get stuff' to your heart's content and make it into other stuff.  The crafting has a good level of depth, involving quality levels and skill levels and particular materials.  At the moment I've only made the most basic of things, but I see the potential here for an exceptional system whereby different materials convey different quality/effects.  <br><br>For example, I have the blueprint for a shirt, and I can either:<br>leaves -&gt; fibers - &gt; threads - &gt; cloth<br>grass -&gt; fibers - etc<br>or some combination of the two.<br><br>Everything is made out of its base components, so if you want to make a hammer, you'll need a head, a handle, and something to fasten them, and so forth.  The crafting UI has little mini icons indicating what is needed and they change color based on what you've got available in your inventory.<br><br>Anyway, needless to say, this game completely allowed me to stand there and make thread for 30 minutes, rewarded me with my tailoring level going up, and I was able to make something to wear.   Likewise with making tools, etc.<br><br>There is also a whole construction element (ie building a house) that I've not even gotten into yet.<br><br>Skills and stats go up slowly as you do things and the UI gives good feedback on success rates &amp; quality level expected of the resulting item.  <br><br>I only did minimal combat, killing rabbits to get pelts and meat, but it was fluid and responsive, ie press button-&gt; something happens.  One of my biggest pet peeves in games is a clunkly/slow response UI so I'm pleased to report that Novus did not disappoint in this regard.<br><br>Overall -<br>The game is certainly playable now, though I'm not sure how many hours of content are available at this point.  It really looks to be something that I will easily get addicted to once I can make a girl character (since piloting boy characters always feels wierd to me), and once there's a bit more direction.  At the moment there is a lot of 'wander around, click stuff, build stuff' and I hope that this doesn't get lost along the way, as it is pretty relaxing to play.   This may just be the PvE sandbox I've been looking for, and fingers crossed it doesn't end up an open pvp mess like so many of the survival type games out there.  And even then, there's an offline mode in the works.<br><br>The devs have posted up their trello planning tool so planned features etc. can be monitored and seem quite keen on getting things done.  I have to say that compared to other early access games I've tried, many of which I last about 10 minutes in, this is a refreshing change!					<div class="gradient"></div>

					<blockquote class="bb_blockquote">A brilliant entry for the survival-sandbox game genre which showcases a mix of sci-fi, fantasy and an apocalyptic setting in a very unique way.</blockquote> <br><div class="bb_h1"><u><b>Game Overview</b></u></div><br>In a TL;DR fashion of the game's backstory, humans went full ret@rd and blew themselves up with radiation and stuff so their &quot;Creators&quot; had to reset the entire race and got each of them some floating iron balls to make sure they ain't up to dumb things again.<br><br><b>Welcome to Novus Inceptio!</b> <br><br>In this game, you are basically an Adam or Eve of a newly resurrected world. You are accompanied by a personal robot referred to as &quot;A2-A&quot; given by your Creators to assist you as you thread a new life in these lands.<br><br>There isn't a particular set of goals aside from surviving these lands or to build your home however and wherever you are permitted to. The crafting system that the game offers is very detailed and complex at the same time in terms of the materials needed for each end-product, and are separated in sections which are weapons, tools, alchemy, cooking, etc.<br><br>You can also explore of different areas or dimensions of the game which are referred to as &quot;anomalies&quot;, which are still subject to change as the updates come but are currently divided into few types. <br><br><div class="bb_h1"><u><b>The Pros</b></u></div><br><ul class="bb_ul">    <li><b>Interesting Game Concept</b> - Along with the very interesting back story and setting that the game has also comes in a great game concept. Some of these concepts really add up to the uniqueness of the game like the aging feature where not only your character ages in time, but also even your surroundings. Another one that I am really fond of is having the freedom to build up your character's skill set is also something that most games doesn't offer. <br><br>    </li><li><b>Detailed Crafting System</b> - The crafting system that this game has pretty much works like every other building/survival/simulation games, the difference that it has from the other ones is that they have made a very meticulous approach on it. For example, some games only require wood and rocks to make a basic hammer and chesto-presto it is done after a few moments of waiting. In this game, however, the materials that you need to provide to make the said tool are more specific, like you would need a rope/string to hold together the wood and the rock, instead just of the two main ones.<br><br>    </li><li><b>Captivating Visuals</b> - It is pretty clear even from the screenshots of the game that it looks very captivating even without me explaining the whole thing, but if I could add something, it is that it has a pretty clean interface that really looks like your what MMOs in the present day has to offer. <br><br>    </li><li><b>Good Audio</b> - The audio made for this game plays out naturally and the ambience effects really make up the feel as a whole. The sound of a process being completed, the rustling of the leaves, the ebb and flow of the water, the whistling of the birds are some of the examples that this game has to offer in terms of audio presence.</li></ul> <br><div class="bb_h1"><u><b>The Cons</b></u></div><br><ul class="bb_ul">    <li><b>Weak Hazard Presence</b> - As of the time this review has been written, there isn't a fall damage factor present in the game, which is a standard in these types of games as it gives a more realistic appeal. Climate penalties also are not present in the current version of the game, in which I hope they developers will add at least before the full release.<br><br>    </li><li><b>No Multiplayer</b> - Usually, these kinds of games are multiplayer-able even in the early stages since these types of games without a narrative or at least a goal doesn't fare for long, except if the game play is fun. However, as promised by the devs, this feature will come in eventually on or before the game exits early access.<br><br>    </li><li><b>Bugs and Errors</b> - Considering that this game is still on its early stages, it is expected to have bugs and errors lingering throughout the game and there are quite a lot of them frankly. Sometimes, there are movement/motion bugs where you go super slow when </li></ul> <br><div class="bb_h1"><u><b>The Verdict</b></u></div><br>Judging from the whole package that it offers as of its current form, it does feel that many things are still missing from it, but it does show the potential to become a great game. <br>All in all, I do think that this game is worth at least the try.<br><br><blockquote class="bb_blockquote">If you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other <a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/recommended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >reviews</a>, or follow our curator group at <a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GoodGamesGR#curation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >Good Games Giveaways &amp; Reviews</a>.</blockquote>					<div class="gradient"></div>

Swap the medieval theme for a sci-fi overtone and it's a similar experience. <br><a class="bb_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8u0Ow5Sy1s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  id="dynamiclink_0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8u0Ow5Sy1s</a><br>For day 1 alpha, performance isn't wonderful but it's reasonable, hit a few random ctds though overall quite stable. Graphics look the part, could use a few more options for system scaling. Amazing soundtrack, both the music and fx work is topnotch. UI was readable and translated well, intuitive though further tweaks like multiple crafting slots would be great to cutdown on clicks required. Starting with little more then a knife and some blueprints, running into new tasks during gameplay tutorials popped up offering more information and further guidance. <br><br>Biggest issue for some will be running out of things to do. Anomalies appear which could be explored, offering rarer ingredients along with chests containing new blueprints. Fort building is implemented, no terraforming was available. Botany, Fishing, Harvesting and in-depth crafting is in. Only aggressive creatures I noticed were wolves, otherwise you'll be killing crabs, rabbits and deers. Something to keep in mind if wanting to play with friends is at the moment you cannot. Game is played in 'ghost' mode, effectively singleplayer that has all the server architecture in place. Also means a requirement to have an active internet connection. One EU server online, didn't notice any latency issues playing from Australia.<br><br>Looking for another survival rpg fix? Novus Inceptio is worth checking out or keeping shortlisted. Just understand it's early days and like most worth a damn (including ARK) they can often take a while to mature. Use a low-end system, expect to spend 10+hrs a day playing 'fresh content' or generally detest grinding? Might leave a little disappointed for now. Will tidyup this recommendation after more game time. Early copy was provided, never changes my thoughts. Cheers folks.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Lots of people have talked about the game. All I can say is that it is one of the best early access games I have ever played. What I would like to tell you about is the author. He is active on the forums, works hard to make the game better, &amp; is responsive to player's needs. Fixes bugs &amp; updates in a timely manner. Offers assistance freely. I think he has a wonderful imagination &amp; with his work ethics, I expect this to continue to be one of my favorite games, getting better all the time. Yes, there are a few minor annoyances, all new games have them, but nothing game breaking for me. I live in the Pacific Northwest part of the U.S., about as far from Europe as you can get &amp; have no problem with lag, or game interruption from the Euro server					<div class="gradient"></div>
