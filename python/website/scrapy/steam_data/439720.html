									<h1><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/gid/[g:1:11802301]/announcements/detail/584721619399401858">Major 1.2.5 Content Update</a></h1>
									<p><img src="http://www.anarkisgaming.com/img/ugtitle1200x500.png"><br><br><br>Unending Galaxy 1.2.5 has just been released on Steam! This is a major release adding a lot of content and dozens of tweaks, requested features and bug fixes. <br><br><br><div class="bb_h1"><b>Major New Features</b></div><br><div class="bb_h1">Play as any faction</div><br><img src="http://www.anarkisgaming.com/img/ugfaction.png"><br><br>While in previous versions you could look like any other faction in-game, you couldnât really take the place of an existing one. This is now a thing of the past: the overhauled ânew gameâ menu allows you to select any of the major factions from the get go.<br><br>Ceridans arenât accessible due to the fact they spawn late. Pirates arenât playable, nor is the Swarm (because they rely entirely on AI âshipsâ). I will see what I can do to make both factions playable in the future.<br><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Dreadnoughts, corvettes and drones</div><br><img src="http://www.anarkisgaming.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Snap8.png"><br><br>Drones replace fighters, they are fully automated, used by carriers and military bases and come with preset weaponry. To fill the void, the corvette class has been added. Those are usually fast, but lightly armed. Combat-wise between drones and frigates.<br><br>I also added the new Dreadnought class. Those are extremely though and powerful combat ships (often coming with drone support), but they are also quite slow and costly. So donât get fooled by the numbers: as with any large ship, they can be overwhelmed by large numbers of smaller ones if they arenât provided an escort.<br><br>While at it, most ships and weapons have been re-balanced, and the worst looking sprites have been replaced by much nicer ones (AI Core cargo ship to name the worst offender). You can look at the various new ships in the <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://wiki.anarkisgaming.com/ug:start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >updated wiki</a> too! <br><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Stability and performances</div><br><img src="http://www.anarkisgaming.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Snap10.png"><br><br>This is the main reason why I want to publish the 1.2.5 version first. To sum it up itâs much, much better. The 1.2.1 was known to freeze completely when you reach a large enough amount of agents (ships and stations). On my computer, it was at around 20.000 of those, this is now fixed.<br><br>Loading a save-game is also much faster (3 or 4 times). Issues of ships duplicating are resolved. Long games in which you saved and reloaded multiple times no longer mess up hangar assignments and so on and so forth.<br><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Miscellaneous</div><br><img src="http://www.anarkisgaming.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Snap5.png"><br><br>There are so many changes itâs hard to keep track of everything. Iâd suggest you to check the full changelog at the bottom of this post for more information, but here are a few of the major gameplay and UI changes.<br><br>As you can see on this screenshot, the shipyard menu has been overhauled, itâs much better looking and requires less clicks to do the exact same thing as before (which is normally a good policy :p). Other menus have been slightly improved and will continue to be.<br><br>The empire manager allows you to set policies for your factions like the ability for your building manager to build outside of your borders or not, if you want to allow your automated military to defend your allies during invasions (which is a thing now: AI allies will defend each other, and they will defend you too <u>if you have this policy enabled</u>), if you want your faction to generate âcivilianâ raiders, and so on. I will probably add more policies as the time goes on (suggestions are welcome, just understand those are YES/NO policies, no slider or values as parameters).<br><br>Oh, and I know many will like this one: <b>You no longer need to fiddle with the various money accounts when you want to build or buy something</b>. The game will automatically use whatever money is available in all your accounts. For instance if you want to build a space station, it will first use the money in your general account, and if it doesnât has enough, it will check your building, then military, then diplomatic accounts. I think I got all menus beside the colony building one that I will update before the official launch.<br><br><br><div class="bb_h1"><b>Important Warning</b></div><br>Note that this version isnât save-game or mod compatible with previous editions. A tool has been provided (located in the data folder) to update old mod files (ships, factions and profiles formats have changed), but itâs delivered âas isâ and you will need to review the changes in the game editor.<br><br><br><div class="bb_h1"><b>Full Changelog</b></div><br><div class="bb_code"><br>Faction AI<br> + Better allocation of money<br> + Better at detecting and responding to building of military bases in territory<br> + Allied factions can defend each other against invasions.<br><br>Balance<br> + Shipyard Build time proportional to ship value<br> + Bounties proportional to military strength<br> + AI Core gains the &quot;fast shipyards&quot;

					Unending Galaxy is a fast-paced 4x real-time empire builder. there's a few issues, but it's got a LOT going for it, not the elast of which being the active developer who is constant working and updating the game, something that is unfortunately rare in the current climate of early access and greenlight trash that permeates the Steam.<br><br>down to business then:<br><br>Pros:<br><br>-Many (positive) similarities to the X series of games, specifically X3 - Terran Conflict, probably the best known of the franchise. This is mainly due to the developer being a serious X3 modder - he brought in all sorts of fancy empire management options and automation that is common in the X games.<br><br>-sophisticated mechanics that allow for deep gameplay<br><br>-variety of ways to play. you don't have to build an empire or colonize worlds, you can make plenty of money and get huge fleets going just by trading, mining, hunting bounties, and pirating.<br><br>-game explodes in complexity once you finally colonize a planet and get around to building industry infrastructure (for some this is a con, but if so, you're playing the wrong game bruh)<br><br>-game graphics are simple, 2d sprites, but this actually helps in terms of being able to clearly identify what is happening on the screen<br><br>-so many different maps, scenario starts, and game world customization options, that you could tool around with the diffenret starting options forever.<br><br>-Race/faction ships all play and feel genuinely differnet, races have well-established strengths and weaknesses.<br><br><br>Cons:<br><br>-UI is sometimes difficult to parse, there is a LOT information to be juggling in your head all at the same time, and those who aren't veterans of the X games or of large-scale 4x/real-time strategy games in general are going to feel overwhelmed.<br><br>-selecting ships and giving orders is much harder than it needs to be. too many menus to go through in order to give simple instructions. Dev has acknowledged some of this criticism and is actively working on parsing menus and generally improving the UI.<br><br>-it's not entirely clear what strengths and weaknesses certain weapons have, and which weapons might be more effective for certain situations.<br><br>-combat is simply too fast - large battleships can be reduced to cinders in seconds by a well-coordinated swarm. ships movement as well, is gnereally speaking very very quick given the size of the individual sectors - if the sectors in space were larger, the speed would be fine, but as it is, you traverse sectors and die in combat entirely too quickly. if you really want to keep your ships alive, you'll have to engage primarily in small-scale maneuvers and take personal control of your battleships so you can get them out of harms way quickly<br><br>-diplomacy is basically non-existent - this is the only place where the game really falls down, IMO. There are no real permanent alliances or trade options, everything is on a timer and will eventually run out. the ai has no real sense, it seems, of where it's fleets are at and what kind of force distribution is going on - generally speaking, when it's time to go to war, the ai throws everything it has at you (and each other) and whoever happens to win the first major engagement will then proceed to (more or less) steamroll the loser. beyond this, the ai is EXTREMELY aggressive. their only long-term interest is war, and when you are just beginning a game, attempting to colonize a planet and build up your empire, you can easily get smashed before you can even get off the ground.<br><br>Most of the cons amount to simple fixes or adjustments in the way the game mechanics work. I'm confident that the dev will get things figured out. <br><br>I would reccommend this game for anyone who liked the X games or large scale space 4x games with a real-time twist. now is an especially good time to buy, seeing as there was just a big content update as well as a superb graphical update which really improves the overal look and feel of the game.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					I think this is a great game and I have clocked in 40 hours and plan to put in more as time passes.<br>First, I will be talking about the look of the game, which I think looks great. Second, I will be talking about the sound of the game, which is good but could use improvement. Third, I will be talking about the games Artificial intelligence, which is superb. Fourth, I will be talking about the games interface and how intuitive it is. Fifth, I will be talking about why I like the game and how it has a variety of play options available to the player. I recommend you buy this game it is a lot of fun!<br><br>First, the games AESTHETICS are great. The backgrounds have a wide variety and are visually stimulating throughout the game. The aesthetics of the different races are also enjoyable showing a remarkable amount of variety that you do not see with other games. The preview doses a fairly good job of showing you what the game looks like, but if you are into building you can set up building patterns and the like. <br><br>Second, the SOUND of music is beautiful, keep the adventure going, but there are some problems with ships firing noises. The game can get a bit buggy on firing sounds both in small and large encounters. Normally, one ship firing will take precedence over the others and sometimes firing sounds will not be heard at all.  However, there is never an issue with the music muffling firing sounds if they do work. However, the game is still being developed, so this could be fixed over time and never reduces or harms the game play experience, especially if fighting is not a focus of your game play. <br><br>Third, the game's ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE system is just amazing in the game. The other factions play extremely well and your own ships operate according to the orders you give them with remarkable efficiency. The game lends itself to allowing multitasking by giving you the ability to order multiple ships to do things automatically. If you have any faction enemies they tend to respond very quickly, which makes decisions important. <br><br>Fourth, the game's INTERFACE is really intuitive. I found myself learning, which menu I needed and when relatively quickly. This was extremely helpful in both setting up the artificial intelligence and playing the game in general. Being able to quickly go through tabs to find information was extremely useful and over time has become easier as patches have improved it since I started playing.<br><br>Fifth, the game is FUN. Their are quite of ways to play the game and things to do and really you have a lot of options. You can build an empire, but that is not necessary for game play. You can play the entire game without ever owning a building and it wouldn't harm your play at all. How and what you do in the game are up to you. With an economic, military, and exploration focus. There are eggs in the game and there are more to come that I look forward to. There is also a very in depth weapons system, and quests for factions with real rewards and a multitude of ships to play with.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Played the game for all of 2 minutes before triggering a bug which resulted in me having ridiculous amounts of money.<br><br>I waited several months after launch before I installed in hopes that the game would be reasonably polished, but such a game-breaking bug so early in the game clearly shows that this game was not ready for release.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Unending Galaxy is a simple game that can keep you busy for hours.  It has simple shooting and motion controls like the old arcade game Asteroids, but it adds in a dynamic to build a civilation empire and own the galaxy.  If you have played any sort of RTS game, like the old Age of Empires games, you get to build civilations like that but in space.  Highly recommend!!					<div class="gradient"></div>

					dev was a mod maker for x3. this game feels like x3 with many popular mods integrated into it with a better interface but in 2D.<br>the good<br>-complete sandbox freedom on how you start/play/what you do.<br>-self sufficient AI. *example) tell your tradeship to auto trade and hire some bodyguards with the profit it making and it will replace them when they die and maintain that type and quantity by auto replacing them when they die.<br>-editor makes it very easy for you to edit any aspect of the game you don't like.<br>-a nice variety of factions and ships. (some of the sprites are edited sprites that the devs where allowed to use like from AI wars)<br>- tutorial covers the core basics and is pretty straight to the point to the point where you can do most things with little issue.<br>-many UI screens are well made  and you generally don't feel lost.<br><br>the bad<br>- mechanics are not always clear and with a lack of tooltips you will find yourself looking online for more info.<br>-the interface is generally pretty good clean and straight forward thought it could use some tooltips to help clarify things.<br>-the information is scattered across multiple areas. the new game screen. the unfinished/outdated wiki/the steam forums/ the official forums (thought both of them don't seem to have a very active community)<br>-getting used to the J jumping can take a while.<br><br>overall good game for it price tag. could always try the old version available for free on the official website it should give you a  idea of the game. (old version is like a vanilla version while purchasable version has a bunch of dlc/expantions added to it)					<div class="gradient"></div>

					I really wanted to like this game, and it seems like it has the potential to be a good sandboxy 4X space game.  <br><br>But the controls and interface are all kinds of clunky and confusing.  What finally caused me to give up was I bought a cruiser to be a bounty hunter, set its AI mode and home system, and it just flew around the system doing nothing.  Its state was &quot;idling&quot; in the assets list.  &quot;Well, maybe I need to manually grab some bounty missions,&quot; I thought.  I did, no change.<br><br>My first 8 or so hours with this game were all like that.  How do I do this thing I want to do?  Maybe this?  I think that worked... maybe?  Can't tell.  Wait, why's it doing this now?  I do not understand what is happening.  Maybe Youtube will help.<br><br>I also did the tutorial, which was helpful, but it broke at the part where you build a shipyard.  I'd tell it to build, and I'd get the construction icon box thingy, but it disappears after 2 seconds, didn't deduct the price from my account, and never built anything.  After 20 minutes failing to figure that out, I just moved on to the game and didn't have any better luck.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					This little game actually surprised me.. Quite a bit so.. It's very simple, yet complex enough to be fulfilling. It has done an excellent job of finally satisfying that craving for a simple space empire/fleet building game.<br><br>There are a few things that I feel could have been done better, and i'll cover those second.. But first, onto the positives!<br><br>1- Simple and effecient!<br>This is where this game surprised me. I am really impressed with the control and management given to the players in this form. Want to play rpg style with a single ship as your own? Or have a small fleet of escorts? You can do that. Want to play rts style where you tell a few ships, or large quantities of ships to perform specific actions? You can do that too. Want to just sit back, and stare at a spreadsheet and operate your vastly growing empire without directly controlling any ships? You can do that too, All the while not being hassled to mine/farm repetatively for 20 hours before you start your own empire. You can do that right off the bat. Additionally, while you do have control over your own faction ships and structures, civillian activity is present aswell. The structures you build will automatically spawn civillian ships which will act like free-willed npcs to participate in the growth of your empire. Whether that be mining, trading, or even bounty hunting. You do not need to manage them on your own, and there is no loss when they get their little pea shooter box-car bounty-hunter blown up by a dreadnaught pirate.<br><br><br>Unending Galaxy has managed to mash all this together in one simple and efficient design where one method of play does not clash with another, all in the same game session. Nor are you required to do one over the other. The controls are simple and straightforward enough, without the hassle of selecting gamemodes or setting things up. Simply generate your world, and off you go.<br><br>The AI works. You can assign different roles and goals for all your ships individually, or in groups, and the optional automation is self-sufficient.<br><br>Now. There are a few things that you need to be wary of though. They are not greatly impacting in terms of gameplay, but they may be unappealing to some.<br><br>1- The graphics. While this does not hold a huge impact on my judgement for this game (as i've all but been able to see past it all), the game does not use original assets, and the most beautiful visuals are the planets. (Like, really beautiful!).. Some assets are open source assets, which included a ship i used to make my first mod in Endless Sky (That was amusing to see!)<br><br>2- Spaceship movement. First and foremost, while I can't confirm this, I feel like the ships use sprite sheets rather than a single sprite rotation system. This means, that while there is a 360 degree turning and piloting mechanism, the sprites do not support directional visuals for all 360 degrees. It feels more like there is a sprite every 15 or so degrees, so rather than seemless turning, it is jolty. This was a huge turn off when i first started playing, but it didn't take long for me to forget it was there.<br><br>3- Lastly.. Crashes..<br>That dreaded thing that no one wants to see in a review of a full release game. On the bright side, the dev(s) are still actively patching or otherwise working on improving stability.. As things are now though, I believe i've experienced a crash every 2-3 hours of gameplay.. Admittedly though, i'm extremely tolerant of crashing issues, provided they don't happen every 15 minutes...<br><br>One final note, is that when I first got this game, I was not able to launch it. I was having issues that was ultimately determined to be my AV.. But before that was figured out, the dev was very helpful in trying to get my issue resolved, and even offered that if my attempts to make the game work went past the refund policy for steam, he would send them an exception to allow me to refund it. I'm glad that it was not necessary, as I've had a lot of enjoyment with this game.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Reminds me of X3 but 2D. Its a great game and highly addicting. Some may not like it, but I'd recommend trying it. Also the developer cares, and he has a very good track record with devlopment.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Unending Galaxy is a fast-paced 4x real-time empire builder. there's a few issues, but it's got a LOT going for it, not the elast of which being the active developer who is constant working and updating the game, something that is unfortunately rare in the current climate of early access and greenlight trash that permeates the Steam.<br><br>down to business then:<br><br>Pros:<br><br>-Many (positive) similarities to the X series of games, specifically X3 - Terran Conflict, probably the best known of the franchise. This is mainly due to the developer being a serious X3 modder - he brought in all sorts of fancy empire management options and automation that is common in the X games.<br><br>-sophisticated mechanics that allow for deep gameplay<br><br>-variety of ways to play. you don't have to build an empire or colonize worlds, you can make plenty of money and get huge fleets going just by trading, mining, hunting bounties, and pirating.<br><br>-game explodes in complexity once you finally colonize a planet and get around to building industry infrastructure (for some this is a con, but if so, you're playing the wrong game bruh)<br><br>-game graphics are simple, 2d sprites, but this actually helps in terms of being able to clearly identify what is happening on the screen<br><br>-so many different maps, scenario starts, and game world customization options, that you could tool around with the diffenret starting options forever.<br><br>-Race/faction ships all play and feel genuinely differnet, races have well-established strengths and weaknesses.<br><br><br>Cons:<br><br>-UI is sometimes difficult to parse, there is a LOT information to be juggling in your head all at the same time, and those who aren't veterans of the X games or of large-scale 4x/real-time strategy games in general are going to feel overwhelmed.<br><br>-selecting ships and giving orders is much harder than it needs to be. too many menus to go through in order to give simple instructions. Dev has acknowledged some of this criticism and is actively working on parsing menus and generally improving the UI.<br><br>-it's not entirely clear what strengths and weaknesses certain weapons have, and which weapons might be more effective for certain situations.<br><br>-combat is simply too fast - large battleships can be reduced to cinders in seconds by a well-coordinated swarm. ships movement as well, is gnereally speaking very very quick given the size of the individual sectors - if the sectors in space were larger, the speed would be fine, but as it is, you traverse sectors and die in combat entirely too quickly. if you really want to keep your ships alive, you'll have to engage primarily in small-scale maneuvers and take personal control of your battleships so you can get them out of harms way quickly<br><br>-diplomacy is basically non-existent - this is the only place where the game really falls down, IMO. There are no real permanent alliances or trade options, everything is on a timer and will eventually run out. the ai has no real sense, it seems, of where it's fleets are at and what kind of force distribution is going on - generally speaking, when it's time to go to war, the ai throws everything it has at you (and each other) and whoever happens to win the first major engagement will then proceed to (more or less) steamroll the loser. beyond this, the ai is EXTREMELY aggressive. their only long-term interest is war, and when you are just beginning a game, attempting to colonize a planet and build up your empire, you can easily get smashed before you can even get off the ground.<br><br>Most of the cons amount to simple fixes or adjustments in the way the game mechanics work. I'm confident that the dev will get things figured out. <br><br>I would reccommend this game for anyone who liked the X games or large scale space 4x games with a real-time twist. now is an especially good time to buy, seeing as there was just a big content update as well as a superb graphical update which really improves the overal look and feel of the game.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					I bought this game a year ago way before it was on Steam. It was a lot of fun then, and since then it has had numerous improvements and fixes and extra features added.<br><br>It's a sandbox top down space shooter with both manual and RTS controls and empire management. You can pilot your ship and go bounty hunting, fight pirates, or trade. As you get money you can buy more ships, set up automated traders, build stations of your own, and even start your own empire that can compete with and conquer the AI empires. You can fly your ships manually, or just tell them what to do and watch. In combat you can just give orders to your fleet, or hop around controlling ships willy nilly if you like. Or play a single ship and have the rest following your orders.<br><br>What I really love about it is what you do actually affects the universe. <br><br>If you're a bounty hunter, you aren't hunting randomly generated quest opponents - you are actually hunting threats to that empire - pirate and other ships (like Swarm) who have been destroying their ships and earning a bounty. You also have competition - other bounty hunters are actively hunting the same list of bounties.<br>If you do trade missions to bring supplies to end a shortage at a station, you actually supplied that station - which will then start producing stuff.<br>If you pirate ships carrying supplies for ship part factories for a faction, that faction will not only be out the ships you blew up in the process - but it will have less parts to build new ships. <br>If you blow up a big military fleet of a faction, that faction will be weakened against both you (if you're running an empire of your own) and other AI empires until it can rebuild that fleet. <br>If you set up stations to bolster a faction's economy, not only will you make money - the faction will be better off.<br><br>Plus there is a huge appeal to me with starting as a single ship and working your way up to conquering the map as a faction.<br><br>Starting options lets you get into the game how you like it - as a single ship, as a pre-existing empire, and a lot of options in between (like being in charge of a small pirate fleet). You can also select from any of the technology groups in the game, which influences what ships and factories you can build.<br><br>I definitely recommend this game. The game has a free version available too to make sure you like the basic premise, albeit with less features (totally worth buying the full version). So give the free version a try - if you like it, buy it.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					<div class="bb_h1">Unending Galaxy: A Review </div><b>Game Detail</b><br>Developer:Anarkis Gaming<br>Genre:Strategy, 4X-lite, Trading, Space<br><br><div class="bb_h1">So What Is This Game About?</div>Unending Galaxy [UG] is a 1 man game about intergalactic trading, empire building, trading fleet management all in a top down 2D view. It basically plays like the X series except well its 2D, the pace is faster, and it could use some polish in certain part of the gameplay.<br><br>Anyways lets get on with the review! There's not really much to talk about in the intro section.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Graphics</div>Lets get this out of the way first, it uses asset packs from the AI war series.  So don't go in expecting fancy graphical settings and so on. But at least its not terrible to look at for one thing. Ok it might be a little be bad if you're not used to it but for a heavy space simulation game like this graphics would be a little be a little be lower on the list.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Sound</div>Just your average typical synth space music for the ambient that you might want to mute off and put on something else after 5 continous hours of pay because eventually they grate on your ears like cheese grater at the end of it. Meanwhile the average sound effects are just pew pew pew for guns and lasers and muted boom for explosion.<br><br>Nothing really impressive here but hey it works. Kinda.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Performance</div>And here's my favourite part of it. You see you can adjust most things from interpolation, resolution, some settings to set compatibility and increase FPS but if you happen to have an anamolous configuration like me the game will be very finicky. As in it will randomly throw out issues at you at random time. I had sprites corrupted, game crashes, spike lags, and so on. It even hates my mobile Radeon graphic card for some reason so I had to disable that and use my intel integrated graphics.<br><br>But when it does work it works very well at 60 fps and almost no lag. But do note the most important part of your configuration will be your processor. The graphics may not be pretty but a lot of process are running constantly in the background and for the largest map it taxed my i5 processort to 100% usage for all 4 core pretty much all the time. Smaller map while... less fun do offer slightly better performances.<br><br>That said it does depend on your final configuration setup so you might get a lot more mileage with it than me with the game.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Gameplay</div>The gameplay in UG is pretty simple. At the start of the game you can choose a list of preset maps [that are pretty resource heavy] or from the randomly generated maps that way less fun than the preset maps but will not set your computer on fire from the sheer amount of background processing. Then you choose your starting type ship type and empire affinity. You pretty much immediately start off as an empire in this game and everybody will treat you as such [even though you might only have 1 ship].<br><br>So assuming you pick the default starting merchant class there are a few things you can do in UG. First you can configure your drone ship to start trading supplies for you autonomously while you lay back and watch as the money increases in the background or you can also do a few jobs while the drone does its job that ranges from killing people, ferrying supplies, to destroying bases and these missions are dependant on which faction and base you pick them off from. Drones [and other ships] can also be set to autonomously patrol, hunt for bounties, and a few other things and task that you can set them with.<br><br>You can interact with the faction and improve your standing with them by doing missions but faction relationship can be improve simply bribing a lot of money if you wish although there's a hard cap to how much you can do this.<br><br>Maps are divided into sectors, wormholes provide quick transportation from one point to another while jump drive provide localize instant transportation between close nearby sectors. Late in the game you can make your own wormhole but as of early point you will be most likely be <br><br>The end goal of this game can be freely decided by you but assuming you want to 'win' the game sort of to speak you need to obliberate every factionand come out on top. To do so you need money to build builder ships which will build space stations that allows other factions to trade with you and generate more income. Once you build up a sizeable base you can then start to build military bases and shipyards outside of enemy control point, this will allow you to finally claim a sector for your own and begin your first foothold in conquering the universe. Pumping out fleets of ships while setting their AI, declaring war on other factions and ruthlessly destroying would then be your main objective and at that point you can simply start building your own wormhole that will not allow others to travel into. A true empire so as to speak from a lowly beginning so as to speak. <br><br>That said money isnt too terribly hard to earn and a typical game will just be over in 5-8 hours [I had half the galaxy conquered in 5] which makes it a lot more fast pace that most other space empire simulation game out there. Being a trader only is also viable and fun since you have to acquire bodyguards and make your own trade and space stations to maximise the amount of profit that you will get.<br><br>Randomly to mix things up a few random event might happen to you and it is up to you to adapt to their coming.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Conclusion</div>At this present time UG is a completely playable game, you can start from a humble beginning and end as an empire and the speed in which you do so is rather addicting with few downtime in between. That said a lot of things could use a little bit more polish to it which includes the UI, the trade section, more automation stuff, and further faction interaction but that could all come afterward.<br><br>For now its a pretty fun space empire management game [especially the trading screen watching the money go up cha ching cha ching cha ching] and since its feature complete and fully playable at the moment that is all fine for now. Although, people who had never play this kind of game should note that the learning ladder is rather steep but once you are at the top its easy to do a checklist.<br><br>Forgot to mention, the game does have a built in game editor so you can make up your own sector and adjust parameters for the ships. It's also rather easy to make up your own mod for it if you want to.<br><br>Scoring Methology:<br>-	S-Rank: excellent<br>-	A-Rank: very good<br>-	B-Rank: solid<br>-	C-Rank: satisfactory<br>-	D-Rank: inferior<br><br>Verdict: B-Rank<br><br>Credit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!<br><br><i>No drama, <a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/justreviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >Just Reviews</a></i>					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Unending Galaxy promises real time 4X with a cool twist - build up from one ship, to a mighty galactic spanning empire.<br><br>However, the details of executing this promise are frustrating to accomplish - all from a lack of information given to the player to the lull of getting from one ship to an empire.<br><br>The game has some great stuff in it from the X universe, which the creator is a modder of. The good stuff is : the ability to make ships auto-trade and auto-mine asteroids to start building you a nest-egg for your future empire. Getting this is no problem at all and is very nicely done.<br><br>The combat however is very break-neck speed in my opinion. Big ships that cost quite a bit of money can die if you dont immediately start evasive maneuvers to get out of combat and kite enemies...that is unless you grossly outnumber the enemy, which can take a bit of time, even for small pirate factions.<br><br>Couple this with the fact that the game never tells you what weapons do differently than each other(even trying to guess visually is very rough), the one dimensional defense modules that just add shields: which all seem to get blown away with very little effort...and this makes managing a small combat fleet disappointing.<br><br>Building an empire is fun in this game. You get to build a lot of trade infrastracture that spans the entirety of a galaxy. But the lack of information on which ships have enough cargo room to build can set the player back at least 10-20 minutes of game time if they do not guess right. On top of this, there is a big system of infrastructure required to get ship parts and supply. which is also not that well explained in the game. This really stops you from enjoying the fun nature of this game for another couple of hours. <br><br>Overall, this game has potential to be a very fun 2D , real time 4X, that gives us what we want - adventures in a big galaxy on a small scale that lead to massive galactic warfare in the end. But getting to the end is a big pain in the â¥â¥â¥ and is just not as fun as it sounds when you see what is happening in the game and know what it takes to get there.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Lets get the bad out of the way first, why you might not buy the game, there are a few bugs, and a few crashes, but personally I only ran into four crashes in my 14 hours of play as of writing this review. Another issue is the UI takes some time to get the hang of, and finally the game lacks clarity on a lot of its mechanics which forced me to test a lot of stuff to figure out how exactly some of the game worked but...<br><br>Putting those issues aside I love this game, I absolutely love it.<br><br>It's a large 4X RTS where you can play as a single ship or up to an entire empire. You can scavage battlefields for parts, you can hunt bounties, you can be a trader, you can claim territory, colonize planets, be a pirate, bring down empires, build them, create a space industry of your choice with factories ranging from farms to computers, to fire arms, fight rogue AI or space monsters, and a lot more.<br><br>You are placed in a simulated galaxy and then told to do whatever you want, that's what Unending Galaxy is, and it will likely become one of my new favorite games.<br><br>As for the dev they seem great, I've asked a few questions and put a few issues on the forum already and the dev was just about the first person to answer all of them, even more so he's already making changes in the next patch based on a couple issues I had, rare to have that kind of on-point activity.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Excellent 4X space game, lasers, missles, splosions, space, trading, fleets, war. From mining asteroids to buy your first cargo ship, to attacking space stations with fleet of warships to expand your empire. Quality game, great mechanics, deep control, will play for many hours. The only small negative is a lack of in game direction before you know what you're doing, which isn't exactly a huge deal for an open world game, but it would be helpful. <br><br>Seriously if you're a fan of the kind of space game where you start at the very bottom of the food chain buying and selling items to various stations, mining asteroids, hunting pirates, and build your fleet dominate the galaxy, grab this game, extremely fun.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					This little game actually surprised me.. Quite a bit so.. It's very simple, yet complex enough to be fulfilling. It has done an excellent job of finally satisfying that craving for a simple space empire/fleet building game.<br><br>There are a few things that I feel could have been done better, and i'll cover those second.. But first, onto the positives!<br><br>1- Simple and effecient!<br>This is where this game surprised me. I am really impressed with the control and management given to the players in this form. Want to play rpg style with a single ship as your own? Or have a small fleet of escorts? You can do that. Want to play rts style where you tell a few ships, or large quantities of ships to perform specific actions? You can do that too. Want to just sit back, and stare at a spreadsheet and operate your vastly growing empire without directly controlling any ships? You can do that too, All the while not being hassled to mine/farm repetatively for 20 hours before you start your own empire. You can do that right off the bat. Additionally, while you do have control over your own faction ships and structures, civillian activity is present aswell. The structures you build will automatically spawn civillian ships which will act like free-willed npcs to participate in the growth of your empire. Whether that be mining, trading, or even bounty hunting. You do not need to manage them on your own, and there is no loss when they get their little pea shooter box-car bounty-hunter blown up by a dreadnaught pirate.<br><br><br>Unending Galaxy has managed to mash all this together in one simple and efficient design where one method of play does not clash with another, all in the same game session. Nor are you required to do one over the other. The controls are simple and straightforward enough, without the hassle of selecting gamemodes or setting things up. Simply generate your world, and off you go.<br><br>The AI works. You can assign different roles and goals for all your ships individually, or in groups, and the optional automation is self-sufficient.<br><br>Now. There are a few things that you need to be wary of though. They are not greatly impacting in terms of gameplay, but they may be unappealing to some.<br><br>1- The graphics. While this does not hold a huge impact on my judgement for this game (as i've all but been able to see past it all), the game does not use original assets, and the most beautiful visuals are the planets. (Like, really beautiful!).. Some assets are open source assets, which included a ship i used to make my first mod in Endless Sky (That was amusing to see!)<br><br>2- Spaceship movement. First and foremost, while I can't confirm this, I feel like the ships use sprite sheets rather than a single sprite rotation system. This means, that while there is a 360 degree turning and piloting mechanism, the sprites do not support directional visuals for all 360 degrees. It feels more like there is a sprite every 15 or so degrees, so rather than seemless turning, it is jolty. This was a huge turn off when i first started playing, but it didn't take long for me to forget it was there.<br><br>3- Lastly.. Crashes..<br>That dreaded thing that no one wants to see in a review of a full release game. On the bright side, the dev(s) are still actively patching or otherwise working on improving stability.. As things are now though, I believe i've experienced a crash every 2-3 hours of gameplay.. Admittedly though, i'm extremely tolerant of crashing issues, provided they don't happen every 15 minutes...<br><br>One final note, is that when I first got this game, I was not able to launch it. I was having issues that was ultimately determined to be my AV.. But before that was figured out, the dev was very helpful in trying to get my issue resolved, and even offered that if my attempts to make the game work went past the refund policy for steam, he would send them an exception to allow me to refund it. I'm glad that it was not necessary, as I've had a lot of enjoyment with this game.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					This game reminds me of a top-down version of the X / X3 series. As other reviewers have stated there are some notable issues with the game play and very little info on how things work in the beginning (very trial-and-error learning), but even with those shortcomings I have found it to be fun and interesting. I am also pleased to find that the developer is active in the forums and plans on continuing to improve it. <br><br>If you're willing to self-dig a little into the mechanics, I would definitely recommend this game :)					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Unending Galaxy is a Sandbox RTS and Top-Down Shooter made by a former X series modder.<br>This description alone made me wanted to try it out over a year ago, and I've been coming back to it every few months since then. Mind that most of my play time wasn't logged on Steam.<br><br>In UG, you're free to pick your goal, map, gamestart and playstyle, or you can jump-in on the default settings and try to take over the galaxy!<br><br>On default, you start with one Transport (Trader) ship and one Cruiser (Combat) ship. This gives you a few opportunities:<br>- Automate your Trader (to trade automatically or to mine), and hunt bounties with your Cruiser.<br>- Automate your Cruiser (to hunt for bounties or raid ships), and perform trade and missions with your Transport.<br>- A few other options.. ;)<br><br>The game is full of such choices. When it comes to diplomacy, you could choose to turn a Galaxy full of hate in one full of peace, or simply turn it all into a free-for-all warzone!<br><br>As you build up your credits as an independent pilot and fleet commander, you'll eventually have enough money to buy a Dock Builder (Construction Ship), which will enable you to start your own empire, produce your own goods, own territory and construct ships for free with the Ship Parts you've produced yourself.<br>And again, you can choose wether to start taking over other empires through war, backstabbing or diplomacy.<br><br>Therefore, the strengths of the game really lie on its freedom, and on the ability to assign different roles to your ships by automating them with different AI modules (Trader, Miner, Police, Bounty Hunter, Military, Pirate Raider, Scavanger and maybe others). Building your empire and evading difficult situations through diplomacy is also fun, and finding different ways to deal with the challenges the game pit you against.<br><br>The problems lie at the fact the game is a niche game. There IS a learning curve, the controls and UI are not 100% intuitive to people who are not used with this genre and, even though the game has a very wide scope, it was and is being developed by a single person - so bugs and issues were probably going to exist.<br><br>However, the developer has a great habit of fixing critical things first, listening to suggestions and continuously improving and polishing the game. <br>As you may've noticed, there were three patches in the first week after release, and the developer has plans for the future and planned improvements for different areas of the game, and will probably release a roadmap in a few days.<br><br>If you enjoy Sandbox, Empire-Building or Space-themed games, UG is a keeper!					<div class="gradient"></div>

					This game reminds me a lot of how the X series games play along with some Distant Worlds and some top down space shooter added in.  It doesn't have cutting edge 3D graphics, but the aesthetic still feels great, the art is smooth yet crisp.  While it does use a lot of the ship assets from AI War, they still manage to feel fresh and don't detract from the value of the game at all.<br><br>From starting with a full empire to play it as a 4X strategy game, to starting with a small fleet or even a single ship to make it feel more like a sim, there is something here for you if you enjoy these types of games. There are 11 Starting Scenarios, 7 total handcrafted non-tutorial maps, a procedural map generator and a faction customizer which ends up offering a lot of replayability.  You can have a small knife fight galaxy or a huge 1800+ sector sandbox universe plus many other variable to fine tune how you want the universe to ultimately run.<br><br>I feel the music is standard for a small indie studio and I feel the sound effects could be better, but neither really detract from the gameplay and they are satisfactory.  Not too much to suggest here as I know how expensive these assets can be to acquire if you want superb and unique non-library music/effects.<br><br>To me, the game is great, I've had quite a bit of fun just trying out different starts and seeing what the gameplay has to offer both on the 4X end and the sim end.  At the basic level, it's very much trade, fight, build, think with the opportunity to play it as a nearly full featured 4X.  I say nearly because obviously some things are missing, like a researchable tech tree.  Your tech is actually pre-determined while setting up the game.  I do not feel that this takes away from the experience whatsoever, but it could for you if you prefer the traditional research trees.<br><br>One of the great aspects of the game is, like Distant Worlds, you can automate a lot of tasks and though it does not reach the level of Distant Worlds, it's not as complicated as that game either so it does not need as much.  For me, it is the right amount.  If you don't like all that automation, you can of course control everything yourself, you can even create control groups and play it as a typical RTS, right clicking your attack groups to wherever you like.<br><br>The biggest common complaint that I see popping up is the depth of the tutorial.  While for me personally, I felt it was fine and was able to easily figure out whatever was not answered in the tutorial simply by playing, I do understand that this is an issue for those not used to this type of gameplay.  It's important to note that this is on the list of things to fix along with the other issues.<br><br>Aside from the readability of the text font on my screen (which I have been able to work around thanks to some help), I do not have any big complaints about this game that would warrant a thumbs down.  In fact, quite the opposite as you can see.  The sheer fun of the game, the option to play it in different ways, the helpfulness of the developer, and the price (a steal in my opinion), this is a fine entry to the 4X Strategy/Space-Sim market.					<div class="gradient"></div>
