									<h2 class="inset">Get instant access and start playing; get involved with this game as it develops.</h2>
									<p><span>Note:</span> This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you

															</div>
							<div class="devnotes">
																	<div class="devs_say">What the developers have to say:</div>
								
								<div id="devnotes_expander">
																			<h1>Why Early Access?</h1>
										&ldquo;Early Access gives players a chance to participate in the development of the game when we are still in a state where active changes are being made regularly. It provides the players with a chance to give their feedback and for us to take that feedback into account as we continue to refine features. Early Access also includes a lifetime Membership option post-launch, and is similar to a one time box price. <br />
<br />
That having been said, we want to make it perfectly clear that this is an Alpha test. You will undoubtedly encounter bugs and annoyances that may affect your gameplay experience. Some features of the game are still being implemented or refined, some graphics, animations, sounds, and much of the interface are placeholders and slated for revision prior to launch. Some parts of the world are still a work a progress. If you are easily frustrated by these types of things, then Early Access is probably not for you and we would recommend waiting until the game launches or hits Open Beta.&rdquo;

										<h1>Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?</h1>
										&ldquo;Itâs difficult to give firm dates when developing an MMORPG because many of the delays are reactionary. The game is expected to move into beta testing in 2015 however, and launch after a few Beta rounds are completed. Players will be a part of the decision on when the game moves into beta and when it launches through the forums on our web site.&rdquo;

										<h1>How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?</h1>
										&ldquo;We have a break down of existing features vs upcoming features available in the main section below. Many features are currently implemented, but a few key features are still remaining including the Hardcore Ruleset and some Sieging and Nation functionality.&rdquo;

										<h1>What is the current state of the Early Access version?</h1>
										&ldquo;The game is currently in Alpha 4, which is the final stage of alpha testing. We currently have a wipe planned at release with no other &quot;planned&quot; wipes between now and then, but that is subject to change if necessary. The majority of the games features are currently functional, though many features are still being refined and polished.<br />
<br />
While the world is almost all available for exploration, there are some locations which have little to no content currently. The hardcore ruleset is not yet available, and sieges are currently disabled due to an exploitable bug. There are also many areas of gameplay which are not yet optimized. You will encounter bugs, and many models do not yet have LOD (Level of Detail) which negatively affects performance. Some graphics or sounds are also placeholders. For example, you will notice that your ability icons are currently split between placeholders and the final versions. This will continue to improve throughout the course of testing.&rdquo;

										<h1>Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?</h1>
										&ldquo;There will be at least three different one time membership options at launch: Silver, Gold, and Platinum. We are currently only offering Gold Memberships, but you will be allowed to upgrade that membership at a later time. In the future we will also allow for a cheaper Silver Membership option through Early Access, but this is currently unavailable as we are worried about having too large of an initial influx of players. The servers still need optimization and stress testing. Silver Membership will not be available until we feel confident that they are ready to handle the additional influx of players which it will add.<br />
<br />
Some of the extra perks that are included as part of the Early Adopter package will not be available at release.&rdquo;

										<h1>How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?</h1>
										&ldquo;We have a very solid history of communicating with our community on a daily basis. We have GMs already on staff assisting new players even at this stage of development and we plan to further expand or community outreach once Steam Early Access launches. The staff includes developers, artists, content, lore, and other aspects of development and you get to interact with us at that level without much filtering or market speak. We are very good at taking constructive feedback (even if it is criticisms), and have a solid record of acting on such feedback.&rdquo;

									<h1><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/gid/[g:1:7431308]/announcements/detail/834664421732317772">April 2016 Newsletter</a></h1>
									<p>We are happy to continue with our tradition of monthly posts, sharing the past month's achievements, change notes, and the next month's plans. We began inviting testers in March, to help us test the game and provide feedback. We wrapped up many items on our checklist, to get the game available for Early Access release. This included improvements across the board, continuing to flesh out the core systems, and introducing some familiar art from The Repopulation, as well as new art made specially for Fragmented. A special thanks again to the community for providing feedback, and for helping us get over the hump to get Fragmented available for a more public release.<br><br>We have sent invites to nearly all registered backers that had requested access, and should see access granted to everyone that owns a copy of The Repopulation in April. We plan on lifting the NDA soon, as well as making Fragmented available for purchase, on Steam Early Access, before the end of April. We look forward to seeing you in Fragmented, and look forward to working with everyone on the progression of Fragmented into The Repopulation throughout 2016.<br><br>If you missed it, for those who have registered their purchase of The Repopulation <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.therepopulation.com/index.php/early-adopter/my-pledges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >in our backer portal</a>, you can sign up for a key to try Fragmented. Once logged into our website, visit the backer portal, and then click on &quot;Signup for a key&quot;. We send out keys every few days from the queue. We have a limited amount, but if you submit your request early, you should get one relatively soon.<br><br>Finally, below is the link to our website for the notes for March. This was the cumulative release of 12 patches in March. If you have access to the private forums for Fragmented, you will find the patch notes there.  After the NDA is lifted, we will begin posting patch notes for each individual release.<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.therepopulation.com/index.php/news/276-april-2016-newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >April 2016 Patch Notes</a></p>

									<h2>8 February</h2>
									<h1><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/gid/[g:1:7431308]/announcements/detail/852673624834367298">The Future of The Repopulation</a></h1>
									<p>As many of you already know, it has been a rough past few months for The Repopulation team, culminating in the shutdown of alpha servers just before Christmas. The reasons for those situations have been covered in previous articles and posts, so we wonât delve much into that except to acknowledge that they have occurred and the game has been in a state of limbo over the past few months. You can find more information on those reasons here: <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://therepopulation.com/index.php/news/274-alpha-servers-going-offline-temporarily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >https://therepopulation.com/index.php/news/274-alpha-servers-going-offline-temporarily</a><br><br>Although we have had numerous discussions on possible solutions to these issues over the past few months, we did not find a good solution that would make absolutely sure we would never have this problem again. Given the circumstances we have decided it would be in the best interest of the game to port to Unreal Engine. This is not a decision that we have taken lightly. While many of our assets will convert over easily to Unreal Engine, the gameâs code will need to be rewritten from scratch. We realize that this will set development back by a significant period of time, and apologize to our fan base for the issues. At this point though, we felt this was the best move for the future.<br><br>We didnât want Repopulation fans to be sitting and waiting idly though while we frantically try to get the game ported to Unreal Engine. Starting in February we will begin testing a spin off set in the Repopulation universe which we have titled: Fragmented. This product is a sci fi survival game which is similar to a more action oriented, and much trimmed down version of The Repopulation. This allowed us to not only reuse many of the same assets which we already had in place, but also makes up the reusable foundations of what will become the Unreal Engine based version of The Repopulation. We will be giving away this product for free to all owners of The Repopulation. <br><br>We also want to stress that The Repopulation is going to continue and that Fragmented will serve as the base for the Unreal Engine version of The Repopulation. This will allow us to have a released product on our hands and a tested one as well to start from as a foundation for The Repopulation. Once The Repopulation is ready to open up again everyone that has access now will be notified and server access will resume. If you want even more information or questions answered please click on the link below and read the FAQ, it has a lot more information.<br><br>We expect that you have many questions and concerns, and as a result of that we have set up a list of FAQ style questions on our website along with this announcement. We also have some screenshots and an early preview video of the work done on our website. The link for the FAQ, screenshots, and video is below.<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.therepopulation.com/index.php/news/275-the-future-of-the-repopulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >https://www.therepopulation.com/index.php/news/275-the-future-of-the-repopulation</a></p>

							<h2>About This Game</h2>
							The Repopulation is a Science Fiction Sandbox MMORPG which is currently in Late Alpha Testing. You should only consider purchasing the Early Access for this title if you are okay with bugs, possible interruptions of service, and in some cases fluctuating features.<br><br>In many ways The Repopulation is a throwback to the social aspects and sandbox driven gameplay that made titles like Star Wars Galaxies and Ultima Online successful. But it also integrates more recent innovations and introduces an array of its own unique wrinkles.<br><br>The driving force behind this game is choice to play the game in the way that you want to play it. The choice to play the game like a traditional RPG or in a more action oriented style. To advance your character through combat or peaceful means. The freedom to craft and harvest without being forced into combat. To act as a hero or a villain. A thief, diplomat, home builder, tamer, crafter, or an entertainer. To participate in Player vs. Player combat or to avoid it altogether.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features Currently Available In Early Access</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Sandbox driven gameplay which never forces you down a specific path. <br></li><li>Skills based advancement with over 75 skills to advance in including combat oriented, diplomatic, rogue, entertainment, trade skill, pet, survival, and advanced skills.<br></li><li>Advanced Trade Skill systems which allow for a high degree of customization in crafted goods. <br></li><li>Players can switch between RPG Mode or Action Mode combat at any time. Action Mode controls like a shooter, but it built on top of RPG mechanics.<br></li><li>Create homes and build cities complete with vendors, props and defensive units. <br></li><li>Dynamically generated content which will change based on how players react to the world.<br></li><li>Unique three faction PvP system, where the third faction is allowed to set its alliances on a nation by nation basis. PvP is entirely optional with much of the world being completely protected from it and players being able to progress entirely without ever getting involved in PvP.<br></li><li>Advanced generated mission system provides a neverending stream of missions which are customized for your character. They are purely optional. <br></li><li>Social oriented features which provide bonus rewards when grouping or working together with other players.<br></li><li>Vehicle system allows you to upgrade and custom tailor your vehicles, even adding abilities such as Shielding, Mines, Turbo Boost, or Combat abilities.<br></li><li>Three different pet systems: Genetic Engineering, Taming, and Robotics. <br></li><li>Engagement system which is similar to a mutating form of Public Quests.<br></li><li>Persistent Seamless World.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Key Upcoming Features </h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Customizable XML based interface and GUI improvements.<br></li><li>DirectX 11 Support.<br></li><li>Hardcore server ruleset.<br></li><li>Re-integration of the Siege system.<br></li><li>Underground levels for player created cities.<br></li><li>Audio improvements as we move some systems from placeholder to final.<br></li><li>Ease of use features to make the game easier to grasp for new players.<br></li><li>Host Player Created Tournaments in your cities.<br></li><li>Raid Interface.<br></li><li>Microtransaction support.<br></li><li>City Perks system.<br></li><li>Graphical improvements, additional FX, and general polish.<br></li><li>Balance, feature refinement, bug fixes and content. </li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Server Availability</h2><br>Being an MMORPG the only way to play the game is online. We currently provide both US and EU servers and they are available as long as there is no scheduled maintenance or unforseen issues that do arise during development and testing. We strive to keep the servers up and running as much as possible, but patching as with any MMOs is needed and will require the servers to be down during the process. There might be other times the servers are undergoing maintenance and will require downtime and we will try to effectively communicate this as much as possible.<br><br>There are no current plans for player ran servers or single player options.<h2 class="bb_tag">3rd Party Account</h2><br>This game requires a 3rd party account to play. A key will be given to you by Steam to activate the account so you can see the list of available servers to play. Please be sure after you purchase the game to create your account and register the key.<h2 class="bb_tag">Packages</h2><br>Steam currently has 2 package options available.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Silver Package - Name Reservation, 1 Repop Token, Silver membership, and Early Access<br></li><li>Gold Package - Name Reservation, 1 Repop Token, Silver and Gold membership, 1 day Head Start, and Early Access</li></ul><br>At some point before release the Memberships will be enabled in game and offer the following: Additional Character Slots, Inventory Slots, Bank Slots, Shared Bank Slots, Mission Slots, and Auction Slots. The exact quantity of these slots are still being determined based on usage and feedback.<br><br>There are other Package options available on our website as well.<br><br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.therepopulation.com/crowdfunding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  >Early Adopter Site</a> <br><br>If you purchase a package from Steam and wish to upgrade it, you can do that from our Pledge Upgrade page as well.<br><br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.therepopulation.com/crowdfunding/projects/the-repopulation-pledge-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  >Pledge Upgrade Site</a>						</div>

					This game was smashed by the fact that the engine it was being built on being pulled out from under the project.  They are now converting the entire game over to the Unreal engine.  The game had been down for about 6 months.  But instead of giving up or leaving the players to suffer the loss they have released a free spinnoff survival game that all who bough the game can play for free.  <br><br>The game is not dead, it is on hold.  There are still full plans to rerelease it once the conversion is complete. Keep an eye out for it's return!					<div class="gradient"></div>

					The game is not dead! Huge engine/development change, frequent updates on their site AND because of the new engine they made a neat survival spinoff to tide people over til the game proper. So far nowhere NEAR The Stomping Land levels of betrayal. ANyone who doomsays the game is &quot;dead&quot; or you are being conned are pretty much so jaded by shady practices that they assume the worst, or want the game to not receive support. <br><br>Keep track of the news, wait til they have an Unreal engine version up on Steam, look at the vids and then make a judgement. Even with the older limited engine it was quite promising, with the new revamps it can be even greater if they receive proper support. It's still too early to know for certain that they won't release the game and reviews saying it never will, guarantee that it doesn't.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					I tried, I really tried. This game seemed to have potential, especially with very active developers. Engine problems and server shutdown notwithstanding, I still can not endorse this game. I put in 200+ hours, but to be honest, I simply never enjoyed it.  The game is very deep crafting wise and there are a lot of interdependencies which made crafters happy I think, but I am more combat-oriented and the combat just had no impact. There was not &quot;heroic&quot;, &quot;badass&quot; or whatever else feeling you want when you are in combat. Combat was simply boring. The open-world aspect felt very, very restrictive. Climbing hills was out of the question and even bushes and fences were challenging to jump. I felt restrained at every turn in this game. The music and sounds felt wrong as well which further killed the mood for me. So if someone does not like crafting, I can't recommend this game.<br><br>On another note, Fragmented, the survival game that The Repopulation morphed into is not bad. Same style, look so if you want to get a bit of a feeling for the game, wait till they let you play free for a weekend.<br><br>					<div class="gradient"></div>

					This game was smashed by the fact that the engine it was being built on being pulled out from under the project.  They are now converting the entire game over to the Unreal engine.  The game had been down for about 6 months.  But instead of giving up or leaving the players to suffer the loss they have released a free spinnoff survival game that all who bough the game can play for free.  <br><br>The game is not dead, it is on hold.  There are still full plans to rerelease it once the conversion is complete. Keep an eye out for it's return!					<div class="gradient"></div>

					The game is not dead! Huge engine/development change, frequent updates on their site AND because of the new engine they made a neat survival spinoff to tide people over til the game proper. So far nowhere NEAR The Stomping Land levels of betrayal. ANyone who doomsays the game is &quot;dead&quot; or you are being conned are pretty much so jaded by shady practices that they assume the worst, or want the game to not receive support. <br><br>Keep track of the news, wait til they have an Unreal engine version up on Steam, look at the vids and then make a judgement. Even with the older limited engine it was quite promising, with the new revamps it can be even greater if they receive proper support. It's still too early to know for certain that they won't release the game and reviews saying it never will, guarantee that it doesn't.					<div class="gradient"></div>

				<div class="content">
					5/15/15 - Just wanted to mention that my hours played is low because my computer melted, but I'm still excitedly following the development of this game!<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Intro &amp; Opening Points</div><br>To start, I want to alleviate concerns about this title as far as early-access hesitancy and the idea that the game won't get finished. I've been following this game for a couple years, and the devs  constantly update the public on the state of the game with monthly newsletters. Additionally, the game has been funded by two successful kickstarters, and was originally going to be funded out-of-wallet by the devs before it became a crowdfunding success. This is a project of love for them and I don't see them failing to follow through on the title due to financial or personal reasons.<br><br>In its current alpha state you should be aware that the game is not finished, but it is feature-complete enough to play and that access to an alpha makes you a tester as much as a player. You cannot expect a bug or crash free experience, and you will be asked for your input throughout the game on how well features or quests are implemented. However, what you are paying for is more than just early access to the game for testing purposes. The Repopulation will be releasing as a free to play game. By purchasing the game on early access, you are recieving the benefits of a Gold Member package once the game releases.<br><br>I want to reiterate that The Repopulation has been planned and designed as a free to play game from its inception. This means eventually there will be a cash shop, but the devs have said over and over that it will be for cosmetic and Quality of Life items, and nothing so broken that it will make the game feel Pay2Win. Member packages, which I mentioned before, will be one-time payments that give you perks like extra bank space and cosmetic &quot;pre-order&quot; items.<br><br>Now that I've got all of that out of the way, I'll move on to the game itself.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">How It Plays</div><br>I've decided to add a section to the review here that gives an idea of the basics of how the game plays, since I realize my pros and cons list (below) isn't super in depth on the different aspects of gameplay.<br><br>When you start the game you will be in a tutorial full of rooms for different kinds of training (a med bay, a shooting range, etc.). The first NPC you interact with will tell you that you have your choice of what you feel like learning. I won't go extremely in depth into what every area of the tutorial teaches you, but I will urge that you visit every area and at least read about every skill you can. There is no cap on how many skills you can learn, and Alpha is a good time to get a taste for what you like and what you don't. Speaking of skills, each one individually caps at 6000 points. So while it is theoretically possible to become a grandmaster at everything, you're looking at a huge, huge dedication of time and resources. For this reason it is recommended that you specialize and outsource for the best use of your time.<br><br>&quot;Questing&quot; in Repopulation comes mainly in the form of missions, which are mailed to you. Missions can be seen as requests by NPCs, and are randomly generated based on your skillset. For example, someone who focuses on combat might recieve a mission to clear out hostile creatures in an area, or a crafter might be asked to create an item and deliver it to someone. There is no overarching &quot;main quest line&quot; in Repop, so expect to have to come up with your own goals and motivations.<br><br>Crafting is a very deep system divided across many skills, including Armor/Weapon Crafting, Cooking, Genetic Engineering, Robotics, the list goes on. Materials have Grades, so not all refined metal will be of the same quality, and this will reflect itself in the quality of the items you produce. If you want to go into one of the advanced crafting disciplines you will need the help of the player economy as no one person can easily collect and refine all the materials needed. I would go more in depth on this but I wouldn't be able to fit everything in this review's character limit; that is how complex you can expect the crafting to be.<br><br>Combat can be done in the usual RPG 1-9 hotbar mode, or in &quot;Action&quot; mode using LMB+RMB and aiming with the mouse. There is a % based cover system, stances, dodge rolls, and resource management in the form of Momentum and Weapon/Shield Energy. There is melee, short range, and long range weaponry available, as well as a stealth mechanic. Every weapon and combat skill has it's own ability set based on how practiced you are with them.<br><br>This is just a very barebones look at how the game plays to help you make a decision, and the world itself has much more depth than I have room to write. So, with that in mind, let's move on to Pros and Cons.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Pros</div><br>-A true sandbox experience. This game feels like a living world, with tons of options. You are not the themepark &quot;savior of the world&quot; (along with every other player that you have to pretend to ignore during the story), but rather a person living within the universe.<br>-&quot;Living within the universe&quot; meaning that your choice of skills, jobs, and things to do is huge. Crafting isn't secondary to combat, it can be its own focus. There are no set classes, you &quot;level&quot; by practicing skills (i.e. using a rifle makes you better with rifles, etc.) You create who you want to be.<br>-Player cities, factions, housing, shops... an economy and world based on players.<br>-NPCs have their own likes, dislikes, lives and schedules. They will talk amongst themselves and how you handle quests will have an effect on how people treat you.<br>-Combat, while not extremely ground breaking, is fun. Crouching, going prone, and the cover system add an interesting layer to engagements.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Cons</div><br>-Because the game is a true sandbox, it can feel very overwhelming. This is especially true if you're not used to this type of MMO. The feature-complexity of the game also translates to complexity overall, and people who aren't intuitive or experimental may have trouble with learning to navigate the menus, crafting, etc.<br>-The UI in its current state is cumbersome, however that is something that has been receiving tweaks and will hopefully improve.<br>-I'll reiterate that the game is alpha and you will encounter bugs and crashes. This is a testing environment, and this con won't apply as much later.<br>-Some people fear that the reliance on player-made content (as a player economy, player factions, and the social experience are a majority of the content as opposed to quest lines, etc.) will be a downfall. I think it's too early to do anything but speculate on that, but it is something to keep in mind.<br>-Combat, while it has its positive attributes, can also be frustrating. It can be maddening to lose fights and not really know why. For example, since you don't have an overall character level it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that because you've been playing your character for a substantial amount of time that trying a new weapon out will just take your power down a little. Because every weapon has it's own skill level, weapon swapping, for all intents and purposes, means starting over at killing level 1 creatures. (There is a little leeway here as you will retain your defensive and generic combat skills, but it really brings home that you should specialize and commit if you're not testing new things for testing's sake.)<br>-Combat can also feel like a means to an end sometimes. As crafting has such a deep and diverse attention paid to it, you wonder if you're just fighting for the sake of collecting materials, which can be disheartening for combat-centric characters. However I have not experienced PvP or non-starter-zone PvE content, so take that how you will.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Final Point</div><br>As the game stands I would definitely recommend you follow it for its release, even if you aren't interested in participating in the alpha.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					This game is hard.<br><br>I'm going to start there. The learning curve is so steep it might as well be a brick wall. Three days in the game and I'm barely comfortable leaving the main city to poke trash mobs, and Ive barely started nibbling on crafting. <br><br>This game is also incredibly complex, beautiful, and clearly much loved by its developers.<br><br>Dont look here for WoW. Dont look here for SWTOR. This is truly an &quot;Old School&quot; game from the days of Star Wars Galaxies or the very first Everquest. This is a game for the MUD nerds and the Tabletop masters with skads of reference material on-hand from the days of grid maps and notebooks.<br><br>There is very little hand holding, there are no classes. Dont complain about haivng to craft a hundred different sub-components to get your speeder bike. Because that's what this game is about! It's about complexity and spending hours to master some tiny aspect of the game that makes you an invaluable cog in the greater machine. I love this game. I love it /because/ it is overwhelming. It gives me so much content dropped into my lap like a knotted fishing reel that I'll spend forever pulling apart the strands until I understand the mechanism.<br><br>That's what this game is about, and it does it very well for being so very early access. <br><br>Now, dont get me wrong. It /is/ still early access. There are glitches, texture collisions, quest-killing bugs, and the framerates grind a bit. But for all its warts, I can see the diamond underneath, and I cant wait to see where they take it.<br><br>In conclusion : Buy the game with the understanding that this is a HARD game, and it is an EARLY game. But it smacks of nostalgia, and it's a wonderfully refreshing challenge in a world where MMOs are designed to cater to the whiny masses and dragons practically slay themselves.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					*edit : They have updated quite alot so this review might not be relavent anymore. Will update once this game get more polished*<br><br>I've never played SWG or UO before, so I was kindda curious what the game like, as I was looking for games that put more emphasis on crafting system and economy like Wurm Online and Haven and Hearth does, and I've been dissapointed time and time again with the current ecosystem of MMORPG. All the other MMO that I've played put crafting and economy as a side mini game of grinding that the only main objective is to drain your gold coffers (so you would microtranscation more gold from them). I wanted to find a game that making something is meaningful, not grinding harvesting and crafting by making worthless items just so you can make the end-game items, and any items you made before that is pointless and garbage after you level up a few times. And this game is EFFING it!!<br><br>This game will be a complicated game to review, since it does have a huge pros, and also a few deblilating cons.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Pros :</div>- Crafting is meaningful. Each of the item you crafted is useful. Each items made is used in alot other recipes. You can make almost every single item in the game. And you can actually do, without too much of a grinding like in other MMO, you can make alot of things using the lowest quality items and its not a hassle to do it at all. But to make a really high quality items, you need to depend on other and this is where the grind is. How cool is it to be a master crafter of making single core processor motherboard :3<br>And I must say, when you make something, the satisfaction is astounding. &lt;3<br><br>- Fitting system. Fitting system is great since you're not tied to a armor or weapon, and you don't need to change your armor/weapon/accessory every 5 levels. If you found a set that you love you can just stick with it and customize your armor to be what you want. Slashing defense maxed out armor? Full armor penetration defense armor? Hell yeah.<br><br>- I haven't experience the player housing, town and shops, but any game with that is a huge plus.<br><br>- Living world. Day and Night cycle. NPC have their own schedule like what Ultima 7 had. Alot of MMO keep yapping on and on about how their game is alive and how the city is bustling, yet when you're the only one in the area, its feels like you are in a town fulls of puppet, every NPC just stand there doing nothing. This game means it and NPC will close shop at night, Guard stop patrolling the town outskirts at night, Guard will change their guard post every day. Shopkeeper will go to the disco at night.<br><br>- Quest is randomly generated based on a template. Each area have their own quest type and story. Not one player will have the same quest like the other one (kindda). While the quest is not that great and buggy, but its a huge step on the right direction. Each quest is different (somewhat) unlike the old system where the same NPC keep forcing everyone to collect the same bloody 10 animal hide over and over again. This game is on the right path, imperfect but on the right path. While you have to send the cupcake to the guard, your friend might be sending some rose to a girl. &lt;3 and another guy is sending a cupcake to the guy in the pub.<br><br>- Away from the stupid classic leveling system. Mega plus. The more you do on certain area the more it will progress, and you will get skill point bonuses also. This is what all MMO should aspire to be.<br><br>- Huge world and multiple passanger vehicle and mech!!!<br><br>- Dance routine (that give buff to everyone depending on the type of dance and the dance step) and story telling (that also give buff to everyone depending on the type of story, plot-twist and ending, oh and anyone can jump in can contiue to story tell the story started by another.). Make a camp in the wild, and start playing the guitar, dance and storytell, and then go lay teh smackdown on the bandit camp nearby.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Cons :</div>- Early Access : God the game is buggy as hell. I know its early access, and people need to be reminded that the game is buggy and it does takes off the enjoyment sometimes (ok maybe more then sometimes). Wait till the game enter a more stable stage if this is your main concerns.<br><br>- Combat is very unpolish, laggy and not particularly fun. Well I've seen worst (aka Fallen Earth) but I hope they can polish it more down the road.<br><br>- UI is nasty. just plain nasty and unfriendly. The ingame Map is probably the worst I've seen in any game, hard to read just filled with freaking orange colored dot that can mean anything, even worst when compared to Fallen Earth in-game map (and Fallen Earth UI is first on my Top 10 list of most nasty UI in an MMO). UI is unresponsive, the map (M and Shift-M) is impossible to use. Mini-map should just be deleted for how useless it is.<br>Crafting UI is bearable, Quest UI is pretty bad. And omg, the talking to NPC UI and speech bubble is horrible nasty piece of buggy crap.<br>Please dev, fix this at the utmost priority. UI is the most important gateway for user experience in MMO. User spend more time using the UI then combat, then gameplay and all the other thing combined.<br><br>- Character Creation is pretty bad too and buggy on top of that :( which is really making me sad.<br><br>- Player economy is yet to sprout because of the lack of player. Hopefully this will change once the game goes Free2Play.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Neutral points:</div>- Graphics is way behind, but if you want to play an MMO with beautiful gals with perfect bewbies and booties physics, then the Korean Dev is working hard to make those. I prefer the dev to spend their time making the game mechanics more unique and fun rather then asking them to spend most of thier time making the bewbies bounce prefectly and copy-paste the old, tired and grindy MMO recipe to offset the time wasted. Rather you should just google &quot;Porn&quot; watch it then come play this game.<br>Back to the point I wanted to make, the graphics is not great, but it is playable. While I would love this game to have the graphic of TERA and gameplay of Repop (wet dreams) I know thats not possible, and I would choose gameplay with a playable graphics any time of the day.<br><br>- Very steep learning curve (like 90 degrees steep, also known as a brick wall), but once you get the hang of it, its like magic, everything will seems to make sense and you will love the complication of the system. Will probably turn alot of poeple off tho.<br><br>- The community is filled with smarta$$. Not quite sure to either to put it as pro or cons. The community is matured, no tarding chat because most of those type probably quit in the tutorial. Unfortunately this make the community very stiff, and  asking a noobie question in chat will usually get you ignored or answered in a non-helpful way since everyone thinks everyone should already knew the obvious things already, and shouldn't be asking about it, and any points/suggestion made in chat that the game should be more easier to understand will be shot down pretty fast. So beware.<br>I find this refreshing though, no more global chat spam about virtual sex and all that crap, god, Tera chat is nasty.<br><br><br><br><br><div class="bb_h1">TL;DR</div>I recommend this game wholeheartedly if you :<br>- Can handle a buggy early access.<br>- Can handle a huge learning curve.<br>- Likes making shiny things.<br>- Dont mind the laser from your gun shooting from your bottom at times.<br>- Likes to support a dev who is making what a MMO should've been all this time, not like all the garbage that is out there.<br><br>5 cats out of 5.					<div class="gradient"></div>

				<div class="content">
					The repopulation is a burgeoning yet interesting addition to the long list of MMORPGs out there, and you may be wondering why you should buy this one as opposed to any others. Well that's what I am going to explain to you today. The repopulation is currently in alpha stage, soon to be entering closed beta I believe. By buying this game either on steam or from their website you are paying for a game which will, at launch, be F2P, however you aren't just paying for early access you are also paying for a number of benefits outlined here (<a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.therepopulation.com/crowdfunding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >Repopulation website</a>) which includes things such as head start, name reservation the gold and silver memberships (which give you increased bank,character, auction, shared bank and mission slots) and repop tokens. The repopulation steam purchase is the equivalent of buying their $39.99 pledge and works out cheaper than the steam version, on a side note if you buy it from their site then you get receive a steam key as well. Now onto the pros and cons<br><br><b>Pros</b><br>-Diverse and free skill tree system (there are no classes so you can specialise how you want to e.g. a flame-thrower wielding diplomat, ironic I know)<br>-In-depth character customization system (plenty of sliders and the like or a basic system as well)<br>-Brilliant Crafting System (the system works out so that your character(s) should only specialise in a couple of crafting skils, however if you wanted to be a crafting master and max every gathering and crafting skill you can, this would take a VERY long time)<br>-Unique quest system (there are different types of quests such as quests tailored to your character, generic quests, quests which can only be completed for a short time, open-world quests involving lots of players, a la defiance)<br>-Lots more interesting content to come<br><br><b>Cons</b><br>-The graphics (when set to maximum are not groundbreaking however they certainly aren't bad or substandard)<br>-Glitches/Bugs (Although I have experienced next to none many people say they experience lags or crashes)<br>-Combat (much like the graphics the combat is neither ground breaking nor bad and with some improval, including better attack animations, they will be good)<br>-Lack of in-depth tutorial (although there is a starting area which does its' best to teach you the basics of the game such as the skill system, combat, crafting etc. it still leaves plenty up to the player to learn. However the community, at least on the EU server, is very friendly and more than willing to help you out)<br>-Lack of direction (This is, in my opinion, one of the hardest things to get to grip with as after completing the tutorial you have a massive open world ahead of you and very little guidance as to what to do, but in some ways that is the appeal of it as you can, from the outset, go out buy some recipes and/or equipment to start your crafting career,go  kill some mobs, complete some quests, just explore the land, try your hand at some PvP (although that'd be ill-advised), join a guild etc. As part of this is the difficulty of finding NPCs; you have to inquire with other NPCs, use your tracking skill and sometimes just bide your time).<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br>Overall the repopulation is a very immersive and enjoyable game, with a great deal of potential, but whether you buy it now or wait till beta or even launch is really based upon a number of factors; can you deal with a character wipe before launch, do you want these extras such as a headstart, more slots etc, can you deal with an unfinished and sometimes glitchy game and finally can you cope with a game that does not give as much of a helping hand as other MMORPGs. I hope my review helps you to make your mind up and most importantly have fun!					<div class="gradient"></div>

					I never had the pleasure of playing Ultima Online.  But I was fortunate enough to play SWG (both pre and post Combat Update and NGE).  Much of The Repopulation is very reminicant of my days as a TKM (Teras Kasi Master) trying to get to blue glowy (Jedi), with some notable exceptions.  Therefore, the comparrison that the company makes is a very fair one as far as SWG is concerned.<br><br>The game is highly skill based.  There are your main skills (of which there's around 75) and then there are skills within the skills.  I will use the character I have played with the most (I've tinkered with three) to try to illustrate the point.<br><br>My main character is primarily a hunter type with some gathering side abilities.  There are several but the ones he specializes in are, mining (minerals and ore extraction from nodes), wood cutting (cutting down trees), and survival (skinning animals and scavenging for water).  There's others but those are the ones I use.  For every mob type there is a set skill pertaining to them.  A common early mob is a Setlang, they are reptilian dog-like creatures.  As you hunt/skin more and more of these creatures you begin to become more and more familiar with them.  So there's your overall skill (say survival) and specific species skill (in this case setlang) the higher they both are the better you do, obviously.  This holds true across the board.   Are you a miner?  What kind of miner are you?  There's a skill for each ore too.  Woods man?  What trees/plants are you good with?  <br><br>On the flipside.  Lets say you go into crafting.  The same thing applies you have your base crafting schools, lets say chemistry, and then you have all of your chemistry recipes.  They have separate skills associated with each one of them (i'm quite the badass water distiller but i can't do acid extraction for crap).<br><br>Harvesting is interesting in that you have several options.  There's auto harvesting (you can put down extractors over some nodes) and there's manual extraction.  Many nodes under manual extraction come with 2 other options enhancement of the node you're on, and enrichment of the area.  As an area is harvested it looses quality and it shows in the nodes.  The immediate and personal fix is by enhancing the node you're working on but it only works for you.  Enriching the area restores the area's quality not just for you but everyone.<br><br>The game is in alpha so please expect crashes, bugs and issues. They aren't abundant but they exist, most can be fixed with a soft log.<br><br>Pros<br>Massive skill system<br>Great in game community<br>Very ambitious<br>Rewarding if you're willing to work for it (those who seek immediate gratification go elsewhere)<br>Decent early teaching methods (nooby training instance)<br><br>Cons<br>Steep price tag for alpha *redacted con, see edit*<br>Alpha lots of bugs, they're being worked on but it's alpha<br>Future possibility of microtransactions<br>Steep learning curve, with many skills &quot;hidden&quot; for you to discover on your own, and little direction given beyond the original training instance<br><br>All in all, if they add a twitch based flight aspect I will be at their door screaming &quot;Shut up and take my money&quot;.  As it sits, for me, it is worth the early investment.  These guys are clearly serious and want the game to work.  That being said I enjoy alphas and betas, and realize many don't.  So if you're one who wants a clean and polished game don't buy in yet.  The game is clean and has some polish, but isn't finished yet.  They are making progress (think an update comes out today or tomorrow actually) but they've still got work to do.  The price tag of 40 bucks for an alpha is a bit steep in my opinion but being that it harkens back to my days in SWG as much as it did I took the plunge, and am glad I did.  <br><br>There's many things that you can do in game that I've not mentioned this is strictly the path of one of my characters, the character is truly yours when you get in.<br><br>Enjoy<br><br>-Rk<br><br>Edit: Thanks to WubZero for bringing this to my attention.  There's been a price reduction removing that con.  Game is now 20 bucks as opposed to 40 now makes it a very viable competetor in the current market.<br><br>They do plan on having twitch based flight once they've smoothed out the majority of the ground game.  So we are at &quot;Shut up and take my money&quot; status.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Initially It was fun and frustrating at the same time...then for a few days it seemed to grind on and on and I didn't see much developing with my charicter...(Because like many I didn't read any of the guides and tried to jump in without a clue.) After I read one of the guides...well...It honestly changed the whole game for me and am now making some really decent headway in charicter developement. It is a little rough on load times and still crashes once or twice every couple of hours, but hey...Its Alpha. It was advertised as such so it has to be expected. Honestly though it preforms better than many games I've tried that were full releases. There is ALOT to do, learn and try in this game. It can be a casual game but it's hard to put it down sometimes even when i'm getting stomped. The crafting system is pretty advanced and it has a new skill system similar to that of EVE online. (Skill books.) plus if you buy the weapon skills you get a free gun, grenade or Sword, ax etc. apropriate to the skill learned. (I.e. you leard automatic weapons you get an assault rifle.) One of my two favorite weapons in game so far are the sniper rifle and flame thrower. (You can also add fittings to the weapons and armor to boost certin atributes.) ....and they have pets! Who doesn't want virtual pets...and no virtual Poo to clean up. They have a limited amount of vehicles that I suggest buying for other players rather than NPCs as the quality, availability, and prices are much better...I bought a light mech...It has a gun...I shoot stuff.<br> It's a keeper.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Did you enjoy playing Galaxies between launch and the CU? Do you like complex crafting systems (the good kind)? Do you like the freedom to level 1 or 2 things or Everything if you want on one character?<br><br>The Repopulation might be for you, then.<br><br>Use any weapon, or heal.<br>Tame wild animals, or make your own to fight with and / or for you.<br>Completely customize the way your character looks on creation, and afterward in-game if you didn't pick the right things. Think about the Saints Row Series - make a normal-looking or goofy character if you want.<br>Entertain and buff yourself and other characters in rest zones like pubs in and outside. Not near a town? You can pop open a tent and do the same with your group.<br><br>Not interested in being a good guy? Stealth your way around and pick pocket / steal from people and shops. Become an assassin with rogue-like abilities - backstab with one or two knives for massive damage. (From my experience, starting out along this path is a little tricky in the current state 7/29/15). There are several skill lines that are beneficial - Stealth, Assassination, Bladed Weapons, Thievery, etc.<br><br>Want to build your own robots, vehicles, and other advanced items? You may want to consider joining a nation (guild). Crafting is complex for most advanced items and you may want friendly teams of people gathering to accelerate the process.<br><br><br>The game is early access, which means many things haven't been refined to perfection, and there are still some features on the &quot;To Do / To Add&quot; list. In its current state, I can still recommend this game to all those interested in it. Be warned; there is a guaranteed wipe slated for the launch of the game. There are only rumours of other wipes between now and then, but no official word on any.<br><br>There are GMs that occasionally do testing with players ingame to hunt down bugs and troubleshoot various things. Watch General chat for opportunities like these.<br><br>On live streams (Twitch) you'll be able to get info on new features, ask about development, etc. As of the one that was done a few days ago, I had the opportunity to ask about Space Exploration (&quot;Will we be Repopulating other planets at some point?&quot;). It was confirmed that this is something they want in the game; Space Exploration and Space Combat.<br><br>10/10 &quot;Shut up and take my money&quot;, even in its current state.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					This being another early access game and I a fan of Star Wars galaxies pre-NGE; I will try to keep this review as unbiased as possible. I have not seen a lot of the game yet, and I have spent most of the time I currently have logged trying to fully understand all of the basic mechanics the final product will revolve around. So this is mainly a performance and theory review. Since most of this game is subject to change over time.<br><br>------------------<br>System Information<br>------------------<br>Time of this report: 12/25/2014, 14:59:00<br>       Machine name: SODOGAMING<br>   Operating System: Windows 8.1 64-bit (6.3, Build 9600) (9600.winblue_r3.140827-1500)<br>           Language: English (Regional Setting: English)<br>System Manufacturer: Dell Inc.<br>       System Model: XPS 8500  <br>               BIOS: BIOS Date: 08/28/13 10:44:30 Ver: 04.06.05<br>          Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3450 CPU @ 3.10GHz (4 CPUs), ~3.1GHz<br>             Memory: 8192MB RAM<br>Available OS Memory: 8152MB RAM<br>          Page File: 3318MB used, 6114MB available<br>        Windows Dir: C:\Windows<br>    DirectX Version: DirectX 11<br>DX Setup Parameters: Not found<br>   User DPI Setting: Using System DPI<br> System DPI Setting: 96 DPI (100 percent)<br>    DWM DPI Scaling: Disabled<br>     DxDiag Version: 6.03.9600.16384 64bit Unicode<br>---------------<br>Display Devices<br>---------------<br>          Card name: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti  <br>       Manufacturer: NVIDIA<br>          Chip type: GeForce GTX 560 Ti<br>           DAC type: Integrated RAMDAC<br>        Device Type: Full Device<br>         Device Key: Enum\PCI\VEN_10DE&amp;DEV_1200&amp;SUBSYS_089810DE&amp;REV_A1<br>     Display Memory: 4043 MB<br>   Dedicated Memory: 971 MB<br>      Shared Memory: 3071 MB<br><br>     There is currently a lot of performance issues for people near or meeting recommended system reqs. The game is playable with my system specs, and in most places I can get 40-60 fps with everything set to low. Granted the options aren't fully developed yet so there is only so much tweaking you can do to enhance game performance. The Hero Engine works in cells. So when you enter a new cell in the world map it can cause a huge drop in frame rates. Another major issue to be noted when considering purchasing this early access is the large memory leak the game has. Generally memory leaks lead to constant game crashes, but this personally isn't the case. The main problems from my experience with the memory leaks is that The Repopulation has a rapid declination of performance over an extended period of play time. Now I am not saying that this won't cause constant crashes for others, and I have ran into a few crashes myself.(The crashes I've had were mainly from tabbing to my second monitor while at the loading screen.)<br><br>     Now, for the people who want to focus on testing out the crafting system. There is a bug that will frequently cause your recipes to disappear requiring you to reboot the game application in order to continue crafting. Another bug that is somewhat annoying is your inventory and items disappearing.(which will effect people who want to craft, or people looking to test combat). The last two major bugs people should be aware of before purchasing is a game crash on respawn, and your hotbar being bugged on respawn and not showing ability cooldowns.<br><br>     Performance summary = EA is not for everyone, and if you at least meet recommended system reqs the game will be &quot;playable&quot;. Keep in mind this is an early access alpha so expect everything to constantly be breaking, or not be working as intended.<br><br>     The theory of the game is very community oriented. I like this concept however in the current state I feel that the direction the game is going in the developement team is relying too much on an over complicated crafting system to supplement the lack of content. The crafting system is extremely amazing and intricate, but the foundation of the crafting system requires a large and active community to keep supply up with the demand.<br><br>     Starting out I felt as if I was missing the direction I should be going or as if i was not &quot;playing&quot; the game correctly. I feel like this thought process came from my experience of all the other mmo's inbetween the time of Star Wars Galaxies and The Repopulation. There isn't a story line that you're tied down to. You choose how you want to play, and the mission system is the perfect flavor for me. You can find missions that are static pick ups off of npcs, but most of the quests will be delivered right to your mailbox. Play the game how you want to play there is nothing linear about it. Do what you want to when you want to.<br><br>     Theory and mechanics review = Intricate crafting that is heavily interdepenent on other people. The load of work required to be the master of a craft is too much for one person. I currently think the crafting should be slightly simplified but with time those sort of things will be ironed out. Being able to pick up and turn in missions on the fly without having to go back into town is just awesome, and you have the freedom to master all of the combat and crafting professions as you desire.(It would take an extremely large amount of time to do so.)<br><br>*Overall review*<br>Performance= Early access plenty of broken things<br>Combat = unpolished but the concept is definitely there<br>Crafting = Amazing in depth system that lets you tailor items to the stats you want and need! (currently over complicated and doesn't have the population to support it)<br>Community = If there is a game to bring back the concept of an actual community The Repopulation is the one.<br>Content = currently not there but this is to be expected being Early access. (Only future patches will be able to tell us what is to come. However, it currently feels like crafting is taking place of content.)<br><br><br>     Should you buy The Repopulation alpha early access? I'm definitely not going to say no, but you should consider some of these things. The Repopulation will most likely not run well, and you will have to deal with unexpected downtimes. However, most of the concepts are very ambitious and interesting. The game has plenty of potential we just have to see in which direction the dev team takes it. Like most other reviews I will also say if you loved SWG pre-nge (That includes pre-combat upgrade AND combat upgrade) you will most like feel comfortable in The Repopulation. For people who have not played SWG if you do buy The Repopulation EA don't get confused. The game feels like too much to take in at first, but it's set up to give you the freedom to be whoever the hell you want to while in game.<br><br>     Thumbs up to The Repopulation it currently has a lot of problems and questionable content. But this is a game that I know has potential to be the next amazing thing, and I wish The Repopulation the best of luck. I will be extensively testing this title!					<div class="gradient"></div>
