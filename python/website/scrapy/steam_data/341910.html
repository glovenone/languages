									<h1><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/gid/[g:1:8504972]/announcements/detail/883072870656605877">End of Season 1 &amp; minor update</a></h1>
									<p>Fellow Commanders,<br><br>Season 1 of Ultimate Space Commando has now ended. We didn't have as many competitors as we had hoped for, but nevertheless, congratulations to everyone who participated and succeeded to get onto any of the leaderboards with a successful mission. All of these players have now been given their RD-1 insignia! <img src="http://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/economy/emoticon/rd1" class="emoticon"> (Don't forget to select it in your profile if you want to use it.)<br><br>The winner of Season 1 is <b><u>Lt. Commander Bozdo</u></b>, who--with a truly exceptional performance, I might add--also earned the Titanium armor customization and the Season 1 Champion ceramic mug! Hear, hear!<br><br>A new Season is being planned, so keep your eyes peeled for more information. Until then, all four challenges remain playable as an UNRANKED mission--that is, you can complete them for a general place on the custom leaderboards, but naturally they won't affect the leaderboard of Season 1 anymore.<br><br>We've also deployed a minor update, see the changes below.<br><br><b>USC v1.0.9.2</b><br><br>-- Pressing 'M' for minimap when it's not visible due to screen size/interface scale settings will now automatically switch to secondary GUI. You can now also use 'M' to switch back.<br>-- If you're on the secondary GUI, pressing 'P' for personal data, 'I' for inventory, F1-F4/1-4 for select unit or 'O' for general objectives/mission info will now automatically switch back to the primary GUI. Note: you can always use TAB to switch to the secondary GUI for the minimap and the log if they are not visible.<br>-- Fixed a minor bug with some mission log entries in Act V.<br><br>Other minor changes, fixes and optimizations are also being worked on, thanks to the abundant and caring player feedback.<br><br>Until next time--happy hunting!</p>

							<h2>About This Game</h2>
							<img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341910/extras/desc_1.png?t=1447366853"><br>Ultimate Space Commando (USC) is a turn-based sci-fi tactics game with strategy and role-playing elements, inspired by many &quot;old-school&quot; top-down view classics, featuring a semi-randomized Campaign mode with real multiple ending possibilities, fully interactive random maps, a detailed combat system with 18 distinct weapons and in-depth mechanics, a lot of unique gadgets, customizable squads with craftable goodies and lootable weapon prototypes, TCP/IP-based and hot-seat multiplayer modes, and an alien horde not stopped even by walls to fulfill its terrifying agenda...<br><br>USC is a complex game. From training your units with skill points and outfitting your squads with the appropriate weapons, ammo and additional gear to exploring, salvaging resources and fighting the alien horde, everything is in your hands. The game mechanics are easy to learn, but mastering them is a grand journey. USC features seven difficulty levels for custom games and three for the Campaign mode, including Easy for learners or casual players, but beating the highest levels requires both sophisticated tactics and a great deal of planning ahead with resources and synergy between environment, weapons and items.<br><br><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341910/extras/desc_2.png?t=1447366853"><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Campaign mode:</strong> Follow and control the fate of the crew of U.S.C. Wraith, a recon vessel stranded on an isolated mining planet, facing a rather unpleasant &quot;first contact&quot; scenario with the greatest threat to mankind yet. Unravel the hidden aspects of the story and try to save all your men and/or defeat the aliens while fighting through 30+ semi-randomized missions, gathering resources and item blueprints in an attempt to contact Earth.<br></li><li><strong>Fully interactive, randomized combat environment:</strong> All map elements are interactive in some way. Gather ammo, Credits, blueprints or items from crates, loot vending machines for refreshment, struggle to seal blast doors to prevent further alien intrusions, hack locked doors in a mini-game, use flammable objects to burn your enemies, find switches to unlock special areas, move almost any kind of objects to make a barricade, bring down walls for an escape route or to gain an advantage, avoid various hazards, and more... all this on randomly generated maps in three distinct environments!<br></li><li><strong>Detailed combat mechanics and squad management:</strong> USC features a unique combat system based on four combat stats (Health, Morale, Action Points and Armor), nine RPG-like attributes (weapon class proficiencies, reaction, electrotechnics, etc.) and various attack properties (e.g. accuracy, impact force, armor penetration, and many more). 18 weapons, more than 30 useful gadgets (medikits, weapon &amp; armor mods, cloaking device, deployable auto-turret, etc.) and even prototype weapons and craftable-only special items are available to choose from as you see fit for your tactics. Your units gain experience in the Campaign mode, but your customized squads can also make progress with their gear even in other game modes!<br></li><li><strong>Various custom game modes:</strong> Beside the Campaign, you can also play the &quot;Defend the Base!&quot; mode--where you get to build your very own base, manage your resources and fight multiple waves of aliens--and fully customizable Single Missions, where you can specify the objectives for each team, set map size and other parameters, difficulty, player handicaps, etc.<br></li><li><strong>Multiplayer:</strong> You don't have to play alone! You can play with friends either over TCP/IP protocol or in hot-seat mode up to four players! You can create co-op PvE, PvP and even mixed PvPvE games!<br></li><li><strong>Original soundtrack and exceptional sound effects:</strong> From composer Dima Arktor and sound designer Eugene Black comes an original sci-fi horror audio experience! 16+16 original music tracks, terrifying ambients and hundreds of completely custom-rendered high quality sound effects make the game complete.</li></ul><br><img src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/341910/extras/desc_3.png?t=1447366853"><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Relentless alien Horde:</strong> USC features an AI opponent unlike anything before. You'll have to fight an actual Horde of ravenous beasts of a living ecosystem. With each enemy type having their special abilities, the AI will try to flank you even through the walls, destroy your supplies, draw your defense fire with lesser units, or even devour them to get to you. 7 different alien species with 'Champion', 'Warbred' and 'Alpha' special abilities will never stop in their attempt to slaughter you as soon as you make a mistake.<br></li><li><strong>Hall of Fame:</strong> Campaign playthroughs, PvE Single Missions and Defend the Base! sessions are evaluated for both a score and a merit. To score higher, it's not enough to only survive: you must become faster, smarter, and plan your actions even more carefully to complete more sub-objectives. Beating the game with a good score unlocks more special craftables--and makes you proud!<br></li><li><strong>Customizable squads:</strong> You can make and use custom unit portraits, squad logos, and can by default rename your units and assign them callsigns. Completing Defend the Base! waves and collecting materials in other missions can earn you permanent bonuses for your squad, enabling you to combat higher difficulties and possibly granting a minor edge versus other players in PvP.<br></li><li><strong>Rubber Duckies:</strong> No, seriously. As part of an anti-piracy military propaganda, United Space Command Forces have launched a campaign to supply their troops with model RD-1 Rubber Duckies as a morale booster--and also as emergency insulator material :) (just to stay practical). You'll surely encounter these cute and useful duckies on your journey...</li></ul>						</div>

					<b>Short Version:</b>  Ultimate Space Commando is a turn-based tactical rpg/strategy game that is completely old school in both good and bad ways:  unique, intricate game mechanisms with lots of meat, but also extremely slow-moving and unforgiving gameplay.  If you find yourself enjoying it, I believe you could easily get dozens (or hundreds) of hours out of this game.  Conversely, it could easily take you dozens (or hundreds) of hours to try and get your enjoyment out of this game, which modern gamers may not have the patience for.  Likely you will either love it or hate it - this is a niche game to the extreme.<br><br>Ultimate Space Commando is a massive game stuffed to the brim with a large campaign and tons of content in the other game modes along with richly complex gameplay mechanisms supporting them.  The developer clearly has put much love and effort into this project, which shows both in the game as well as their online presence - they appear to be extraordinarily active and helpful in the forums as well as the enormous (and necessary) online guide for the game.  <br><br>In the game, you take your squad of Ultimate Space Commandos into the depths of a harrowing alien world, inhabited by countless hostile aliens that bear a striking resemblance to... well, 'Alien'.  The dark, foreboding atmosphere lit only by your active scanners and field of vision sets a perfect stage for your wary approach into the unknown, where monsters may suddenly swarm you or even start chewing through the walls to get to your tasty team. The gameplay itself is rather enjoyable, with every action needing to be carefully planned out to best make use of your extremely limited action points, ammo, randomly obtained gear, and the uniquely developed skill-sets of your party.<br><br>Alas, with all these wonderful things going for it, I still cannot recommend the game in its current state.  As much as I want to like Ultimate Space Commando... the game feels like an Early Access version to me, rather than a fully finished product. This is mainly due to the incredibly slow pacing of the game and the presence of at least one gamebreaking bug.<br><br>Turn-based strategy games are usually slow by design, as you must plan out every single movement to efficiently win battles.  However, with 4 separate characters, each with many actions per turn - and dozens of enemies on screen with the same - battles in Ultimate Space Commando can last for aaaages.  The painful inventory management slows down the action even more, as four distinct 9-slot inventories must be carefully arranged and rearranged with all the scraps and items you find.  <br><br>As for the bugs... let me set the stage.   Imagine that you are a member of an undergeared and overwhelmed elite fighting squad, who has found a brief respite from the action by jamming into a tiny elevator car only big enough for the 4 of you.<br><br><i>  The tension builds as the transport creeps down to what may very well be your doom.  As the doors finally open, acid-drooling alien monstrosities swarm you from all directions, and you bust out the big guns, fighting through the endless swarm for hours.  You slowly go through your extra inventory, throwing grenades and popping medkits, and the end seems to be in sight.  BUT THEN, aliens break through the wall near your poor, weaksauce technician, swarming him unexpectedly.  A messy death follows shortly after.  <br><br>As you prepare to enter the afterlife... lo and behold you instead find yourself BACK in the elevator, jammed into a tiny car only big enough for the 4 of you.  The tension builds as the transport creeps down to what may very well be your doom.  As the doors finally... wait, what?  The doors won't open???? EVER????   You mean.... we're stuck in this elevator for eternity, with no other save points to go back to???? Nooooooooooooooooooooo!  </i><br><br>Yup.  That happened.  <br><br>In a very long game that relies on a single auto-save to keep the feeling that your past actions matter (*see edit*), gamebreaking bugs like this can be pretty frustrating.  I also experienced a couple of game crashes on loading levels (although my save files were still fine in those instances).  From the forums, it appears things like crashes and unending levels have happened to others as well, though not frequently and the developer seems very quick to patch them out.<br><br>--<b>(EDIT:</b> *The developer pointed out that players can enable an option that allows an extra backup save.  I would highly recommend this, even with the in-game restriction of having your campaign labeled as a 'training drill'.)<br><br>The campaign's narration could also use that final bit of polish that takes it to the level of a $20 game. The story of the game seems rather well done, but... the actual words used to convey the story?  Not so much.  While reading sentences that sometimes lack punctuation or need to be rearranged to make sense does have its own special retro charm, putting the game script into the hands of an editor would probably be a good idea.  This mild lack of editing just adds to the feel that the game hasn't quite made it to the final release (though to be fair, this can easily be overlooked in favor of the incredibly deep gameplay).<br><br>In the end... I still see huge potential in this game, and strategy fans may find endless hours of entertainment in USC's immense, immersive world - especially with the outstanding community events the developer has hosted.  If this were an Early Access title I would definitely give it a thumbs up...however, I just can't bring myself to fully recommend it as a finished product.  I wholeheartedly hope that Ultimate Space Commando will do well and keep getting patched to smooth out the experience, but right now you may need to be a very patient gamer to get the most out of this so-close-to-amazing game.  <br><br><blockquote class="bb_blockquote">Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

					Steamified Â» Indie Spotlight Â» Ultimate Space Commando: Turn-based Tactics in Space<br>Ultimate Space Commando: Turn-based Tactics in Space<br>  BY STEAMIFIED APRIL 12, 2016 INDIE SPOTLIGHT<br>Indie Spotlight: Ultimate Space Commando<br>Indie Spotlight: Ultimate Space Commando<br><br><br>Developer	Creatio 49	Publisher	Angry Cat Ltd.<br>Release Date	13 May, 2015	Genre	Indie, RPG, Strategy, Turn-based Tactics<br>Official Website	Twitter	Facebook	Steam<br>STEAMIFIED IN A NUTSHELL<br>Ultimate Space Commando marks the Steam debut of Creatio 49. Itâs a turn-based tactics game that has been set in the era of early interstellar colonization. Youâre looking at a small indie teamâs attempt to enter the same genre as the XCOM franchise among others. Somewhat surprisingly their take on the genre is more polished and enjoyable than I thought that it was going to be. Similar to other games within the genre, players have the opportunity to customize four-troop squads with weapons, ammunition and tools. While the core of the gameplay is turn-based there is a well implemented RPG-style management system.<br><br>There is a lengthy campaign mode which I have yet to complete but I can tell you that it is immersive and is soundly designed. The basis of the campaign is controlling the fate of the crew of the U.S.C. ship Wraith which is a recon vessel stranded on an isolated mining planet. Itâs your a typical first contact scenario that, of course, poses the greatest risk to the survival of humanity. There are over thirty missions â of varying length â within the campaign â so to suggest that there are many hours worth of content within the campaign alone would be considered an understatement.<br><br>A fantastic touch by the developers was making the combat environment fully interactive. What this feature actually does is enable a superior level of strategy than would otherwise be possible. The interactive environments work hand in hand with the deep combat mechanics and squad management tools. Incorporated into the combat system are four statistics that are all of significant importance â health, morale, action points and armor as well as nine attributes that have essentially been stripped from an RPG game. The amount of weapon types (18) and gadgets (30+) help make the game one of the deepest strategy games that Iâve ever played. It all works exceedingly well and although it may lack the polish of an XCOM it is well and truly worth your time if you are in any way enamored with the genre. If youâre not then the earlier levels will serve as a great learning tool for the game.<br><br>Of course, there are further game modes beyond the campaign including defend the base and an almost limitless single mission structure where the size of the map, difficulty, player handicaps, the objectives and more are all able to be customized. My personal favorite game mode, even ranking it ahead of the great campaign, is the defend the base mode. In this mode you have to build your base while incorporating resource management and survive wave after wave of alien attacks.<br><br>There are trading cards to be harvested and multiplayer availability. Unfortunately the developers are yet to incorporate Steam achievements into their game but their definitely is the potential of them being added. In regards to the multiplayer game there was a season one competitive mode. Season two is being planned but the developers are hoping to get a larger player base so that they can make that even more challenging and engaging than the exciting first season. Iâm certain that Lt. Commander Bozdo will be back to defend his crown.<br><br>Ultimate Space Commander is one of the deepest games that weâve covered to date. Iâm certain that Iâve only just scratched the surface of what is available to players and as such Steamified wholeheartedly recommends it.<br><br>For more reviews and our popular giveaways please visit <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.steamified.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >http://www.steamified.com</a>.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					You can read a compared review with Templar Battleforce here<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ReviewersGuild/discussions/0/385429125014825200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ReviewersGuild/discussions/0/385429125014825200/</a><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Setting and Story</div><br>The single player campaign is about an elite commando-like group of soldiers, stranded in space after a ship breakage, and having to confront an horde of aliens that have taken over the planet on which the ship crashed. The goal, or at least the intention, is to get back to civilization safe and sound. Dialogue mostly happens at the beginning of missions, and is of little importance. 5/10<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Game Modalities</div><br>There are also alternative game modes (defend the base/play random map) the can be played on co-op. The campaign itself is around 30h or more, the replay value is also quite good. 7/10<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Character Development, Stats &amp; Equipment</div><br>There aren't different classes, but different ranks based on the experience level. You gain more experience on the field, depending on inflicted damage, and special actions, such as hacking secure doors, closing hatches, etc. When soldiers gain a level of experience, they get skill points to distribute on a number of skills (melee/small arms/heavy weapons, reaction, engineering, biochemistry and all sorts of skills you can expect in a turn based game). Different soldiers have also a specialization, that makes them better in a certain role. New equipment is salvaged from the field, including blueprints for new kinds of ammo, new weapons, new gear or special weapon prototypes. Moreover, on the field you'll be able to salvage special components used to craft prototypes or other gear. This feature is slightly annoying because you have to manually pick everything up, it get tedious especially for screws and other crafting material. Another aspect to ponder is that the gear found on the field can be extremely random. In my first playthrough, I found the automated turret (a very powerful piece of equipment) near the end of the campaign, while in my second run I found it in the second mission. There's a good variety of weapons and ammo types. 7/10<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Combat and Gameplay</div><br>The combat system is indeed the core of the game. The most peculiar aspect is that all weapons have distinct fire modes, that in turn may have different firing patterns (for example 'star' means cardinal direction plus diagonals, 'free' can reach any square that isn't blocked etc.) and different area of effect (single square, 3x3, 5x5, along a line etc.). I was sceptical at first because I wanted to be able to shoot everywhere my line of sight allowed me to, but after a while I can say it's a very good system, it makes all weapons uique and soldiers with different weapons will have to cover different roles. There's also a wide range of ammunition calibres and types (incendiary, armor piercing, marker tranquilizing, etc). You'll often find ammo crates or kerosene barrels, that can catch fire and explode. Morale plays also a big role, there's a morale requirement for anything that isn't shooting (moving, using items, entering defend mode, etc.)<br>Many lesser aliens leave on death a radioactive substance that will poison you if you enter a square covered with it (you can clear it with fire or moving a crate over the said square). And fire, that can damage you and the aliens. Pathfinding is quite good, dangerous square (with fire or radiation) will be avoided by default, and the UI will warn you if you will take damage in your chosen path.<br>Another big plus is that there is a real lighting system: aliens in the dark, when they can be seen, are more difficult to hit. Later in the game, a kind of alien appears that projects darkness all around itself, making it and the nearby aliens much more difficult to hit (there's a pistol that can shoot flare ammunition).<br>Most missions are of the 'seek and destroy' type, only a few have some more interesting goal. 9/10<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Graphics and Sound </div><br>Graphics are in pure 2D, the alien sprites and the backgrounds are well drawn, your soldiers not as much. Animations are non-existent, except for explosions. The music of the main menu sets the right atmosphere, but the in-game music does everything it can to ruin it. Sound effects on the other hand are very good, again with the exception of the voices of your soldiers when they're wounded. 5/10<br><br><div class="bb_h1">User Interface</div><br>Very old-fashioned. There is a total lack of tool-tips, and the tutorial doesn't help you much to understand it. There's no way to know if an alien has been poisoned or suffers damage over time, or its armor. Sometimes you can read its hit points (probably skill-related). There are also some 'undocumented' features, by pure chance I discovered I could split stacks in my inventory right-clicking on an empty square. On the plus side, all keys are customizable. After you get used to it, it's all right, but a less wordy and more to-the-point tutorial would help you understand it better. 5/10<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Enemies' Variety, AI &amp; Difficulty </div><br>The basic enemy types are not plentiful, but each of them can be seen in a lot of varieties. Some of them may have increased armor, health, action points, life stealing attacks, explode after death and other attributes. They are named in a way that remembers Tales of Maj'Eyal. Interestingly, the most powerful aliens will have their turn split in two phases, the second of which is processed after all other aliens have moved. 6/10<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Interactivity of the Environment </div><br>Pretty much everything on the field is destructible, you can also pull or push crates or barrels around to raise a barricade or to clear radiation. You can pick objects from the ground, or pass them from soldier to soldier. I've already mentioned the lighting system. Definitely one of the strong points of the game. 8/10<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Immersion</div><br>Immersion isn't too good, mostly because of the lacking music and the thin background story. Also, it takes some time to get used to the interface, the firing patterns and the various gameplay elements. The developer has a sympathy for ducks, and in the maps you'll find some 'vendor machines' that can boost your health, action points or morale. This can take away a bit of the 'seriousness' and/or the immersion, depending on your tastes, but I can't say it bothered me. Could be better, but not too important. 6/10<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Bugs</div><br>Unfortunately it hasn't been a bug-free experience for me. There are some CTDs, luckily harmless because the games always saves before crashing. I suggest you don't use the abort/redo mission feature, because it gave me some nuisances. Only start a mission when you're ready. The developer is present in the forum if you need help, but some bugs still have to be fixed. 5/10<br><br><div class="bb_h1"> BOTTOM LINE </div><br>It takes time to appreciate it. Very challenging at the highest difficulty setting, there are some multiplayer options (that I didn't test) for those who look for some online co-op fun. I have the impression that a game/campaign editor would greatly benefit the game, but at this time there is none. Rather uneven in its delivery, but tactical combat is definitely brilliant. The price is probably excessive at 20$, maybe reflecting the fact that it's a one-man (woman) project that has been in development for some years. Because of there rare but annoying bugs, you'll also need to be more patient than usual.<br><br><div class="bb_h1"> 7/10 </div><br>(if you are a very old-school gamer you can add a point)					<div class="gradient"></div>

					If you like games like the old school xcom, jagged alliance, or the old space hulk, you will feel at home and love this game.<br>The randomized elements, different game modes (single mission with different challenges) the big campaign (with meaningfull choices) and defend the base all feel unique and will keep the experience fresh and make you come back for more.<br>The animations could be better but that is pretty much the only flaw in this game, and it is perfectly understandable since it is a one-person project.<br>8/10, would die because of stupid mistakes again ;)					<div class="gradient"></div>

					This is what I would call a very good turn-based tactical sci-fi squad combat CRPG.<br><br>There's a fair amount to absorb at first, and when I first saw the battle maps it took a while to absorb, but it soon became natural and made sense. The combat similarly seemed very chaotic at first (especially when I jumped right into a one-off single mission with hordes of weird aliens - I tried to hide in my elevator but they started eating through the walls and electrocuting me and who knows what. But then I started the campaign and tutorial scenario and it was nice and slow and full of skippable explanations and things made sense from there out. Now there is still often all sorts of chaos, but it makes sense and I get what's going on even when monsters are eating through nearby walls and chain reactions of fuel and ammunition are ripping through a base and setting monsters on fire who go running away while other types come creeping in, etc...<br><br>It has most of the things I want in such a game, including many that are fairly hard to find all in one game:<br><br>* A campaign where you can manage your squad, trying to keep them alive through many battles, see them improve through experience and adjust their equipment and so on.<br>* Enough challenge and risk and permadeath, and no expectation to savescum/replay when things go wrong.<br>* More or less fully destructable environment, where missed shots and violence damage everything - walls and doors and objects, accidental &quot;friendly&quot; fire, etc.<br>* Tactics that mostly make sense and arise naturally from simulating the situation in ways that mostly make sense, with overwatch, use of cover and doors, a variety of weapon effects and skills, etc.<br>* Interesting, meaningful, and logical choices both at the tactical level and between missions.<br>* Freedom to try various approaches, as far as weapons and tactics, but also taking time to rest and repair at the risk the aliens will come after your base, etc.<br>* In the campaign, you manage 16 men but only use one or two squads per mission, so you can choose who to send on attacks, who to leave behind resting or doing repairs, and whether to try to get experience for the greener people or not.<br>* Nice relative absence of contrived scenarios and hoops to jump through, compared to some games. More of a chaotic simulation feel, which I like, though also with a fun/gamey/dark-humorous flavor.<br>* Details of ammo/equipment management, but not too much.<br><br>One great thing I didn't expect is the Defend The Base mode, which lets you set up a base and try to defend it against increasingly stronger waves of aliens, with damage details (including spilled fuel and acid and so on) being carried over, and limited resources to repair or re-arrange things, and an option to retreat rather than hold once the position seems untennable. Nice!<br><br>Also, the game is still in development and the developer is listening and adding some things that players have asked for, which is awesome, and in my very long experience with games, is what makes for the best games. For example, one thing that was jarring to me was the firing arcs of some weapons, which were limited during one's own turn to firing along straight or diagonal grid lines, which the developer had an interesting intention for doing, but which seemed unnatural to me (in contrast to the way most of the rest of the game works in ways I would expect, in nice detail, in fact). Turns out in response to player comments, they are working for an option to not do that, for players who don't want it, which may be in the next patch. Sweet!<br><br>I have a few gripes but nothing major. The odd firing arcs of some weapons was probably my biggest nitpick. The looting and inventory manipulation can be a bit fiddly but it hasn't bothered me too much yet, and I quite appreciate all the detail and choices. I could even wish it were more fiddly, as I find the recycler and manufacturing of new items during the campaign is very generous and I'd be interested to have to make do more with what I find. (Though without the recycler/manufacturer the lack of storage slots would become an issue.) Mainly I'd just like more of the same. I expect I will eventually have had enough for a while and wish for another campaign, but for now I'm happily hooked.<br><br>Anyway, I quite recommend Ultimate Space Commando!					<div class="gradient"></div>

					This game is excellent. It's not entirely perfect, but even then what few mistakes it makes are primarily in the UI, the writing and the walls of text in the tutorial, they all manage to feed that nostalgic, retro feel. Everything else fits in perfectly. Creatio 39 has managed to create an old fashioned turn based tactical game, keeping all the things we used to love while not being a slave to it. The game has learned from the mistakes of previous generations, built upon them, and it tells.<br><br>The balance of the game feels solid. It can be a little jarring to newcomers to see that even the easiest enemies can take several rounds and plenty of ammo to kill, but it serves to create a surprisingly frantic and intense experience -- even when you can take all the time in the world. The enemies are always crashing down on you, your ammo is always in limited supply, and the battlefield is in constant motion.<br><br>The battlefield, on that note, is a fantastic part of the game. It's incredibly dynamic. When the enemies can't reach you, they'll chew through crates, barrels doors and walls to get to you. Holding them off requires not only plenty of situational awareness. You'll need to watch the walls, look for cracks, identify which ones are the closest to collapsing. But more than that, both you and the enemy can partake in a bit of area denial tactics.<br><br>Some of the monsters when killed will leave behind patches of radiation. Stepping into those will give you a long lasting damage-over-time effect that'll tick your health down every turn. On the flip side, you've got kerosene on your side. Not only can you push and pull barrels around, you can actually drain them into your inventory, then splash them onto the ground. You can coat hallways and rooms in this flammable liquid - and it'll do exactly what you think. However, keeping them in the barrels lets you shoot and set off a single point, dealing extra damage. That, however, means pushing and pulling it into position.<br><br>Crates of ammo can be another terrific tool. You can use them to get a full clip of ammo into your currently held weapon, or as improvised explosives. These can be extremely powerful against groups of enemies, it's just the question of how badly you want the ammo it holds.  With all these different elements going on, it's no surprise that when fire gets mixed in, things get frantic. Suddenly your soldiers have to dance between walls of flame, puddles of radiation and the enemies themselves, all the while having to worry about setting off any remaining explosives and crumbling walls.<br><br>The game is hard, but it never feels like you've been cheated when something goes wrong. The balance is fair. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you do it gives you a very rewarding experience. This is a game that rewards you for being able to adapt to different situations, for being able to recover control when things go wrong and for knowing when to give up and fall back.<br><br>For any fan of turn based tactics, I recommend this game heartily.					<div class="gradient"></div>

				<div class="content">
					This is a tactical squad game in the mould of classics like Rebelstar (if you're old enough to remember that), Laser Squad and XCOM or, more recently, Halfway. It doesn't perhaps expand on them a great deal. You do the usual of equipping your squad with a range of weaponry and other equipment, finding upgrades, crafting materials and protoypes to get better weaponry, whilst gunning down aliens en masse on te tactical map. A game doesn't really need to expand on something like Laser Squad to be good fun. And this is mostly true of USC.<br><br>Killing aliens seems to be a case of expending huge amounts of ammo; clicking lots of times for low-cost shots that knock of relatively small amounts of health. This gives the game a certain attractive aesthetic I quite like of marines pouring vast quantities of lead at hordes of aliens. On the other hand, it also takes quite a lot of time and makes it seem like a bit of a grind. Aliens explode into blood splats (often toxic radioactive blood that is dangerous to step into), and the playing area rapidly fills up. Preparation is a big part of USC: you have to make sure you go into a level with the right weapons, equipment and enough ammo, otherwise you'll be in trouble.<br><br>However, USC is rather a mess. The UI is undoubtedly clumsy. Sure, you'll learn to navigate it at least reasonably smoothly, but it should be better. Everything is graphically cluttered: the interface, the levels which are totally full of stuff and frequent narrow corridors (reminiscent of Space Hulk). I find the procedurally drawn levels have annoying bugs: corridors without access except by destroying walls; once my marines arrived into a level and the start room opened straight into half a dozen crates blocking the passageway that I had to destroy before I could go anywhere. I'm not sure how well worked many levels are: some listed the resistance as &quot;low&quot; and yet my squad of four ended up permanently swarmed by aliens (aliens can spawn: no matter how many I killed, there seemed to still be another 40 left) until I ran out of ammo and/or medkits. Unless the mission is some sort of hold out as long as possible (and it wasn't), this is more tedious than it is fun.<br><br>In the end, I think USC is a significantly flawed and slightly frustrating game that falls well short of what it could have been, and in some ways less fun than its stylistic ancestors. Nevertheless, if you like this sort of Laser Squad type of game, you'll find something to enjoy, and it has some promise that I hope the developers build on.<br><br>It is with these caveats and the modest price tag I just about recommend it; I would be far less forgiving were it more expensive.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					An interesting game with some intense combat and roguelike dead system. You command 4 customizable squads of four marines with the usual skills: weapon skills / first aid / reaction / health / stamina(AP) and dying is dying. <br>There is also equipment upgrading via new weapons / prototype weapons and modding. + There is research through which you probably proceed through the game .. not far enough to be sure yet. Definitely worth a try!<br><br>					<div class="gradient"></div>

					This is what I would call a very good turn-based tactical sci-fi squad combat CRPG.<br><br>There's a fair amount to absorb at first, and when I first saw the battle maps it took a while to absorb, but it soon became natural and made sense. The combat similarly seemed very chaotic at first (especially when I jumped right into a one-off single mission with hordes of weird aliens - I tried to hide in my elevator but they started eating through the walls and electrocuting me and who knows what. But then I started the campaign and tutorial scenario and it was nice and slow and full of skippable explanations and things made sense from there out. Now there is still often all sorts of chaos, but it makes sense and I get what's going on even when monsters are eating through nearby walls and chain reactions of fuel and ammunition are ripping through a base and setting monsters on fire who go running away while other types come creeping in, etc...<br><br>It has most of the things I want in such a game, including many that are fairly hard to find all in one game:<br><br>* A campaign where you can manage your squad, trying to keep them alive through many battles, see them improve through experience and adjust their equipment and so on.<br>* Enough challenge and risk and permadeath, and no expectation to savescum/replay when things go wrong.<br>* More or less fully destructable environment, where missed shots and violence damage everything - walls and doors and objects, accidental &quot;friendly&quot; fire, etc.<br>* Tactics that mostly make sense and arise naturally from simulating the situation in ways that mostly make sense, with overwatch, use of cover and doors, a variety of weapon effects and skills, etc.<br>* Interesting, meaningful, and logical choices both at the tactical level and between missions.<br>* Freedom to try various approaches, as far as weapons and tactics, but also taking time to rest and repair at the risk the aliens will come after your base, etc.<br>* In the campaign, you manage 16 men but only use one or two squads per mission, so you can choose who to send on attacks, who to leave behind resting or doing repairs, and whether to try to get experience for the greener people or not.<br>* Nice relative absence of contrived scenarios and hoops to jump through, compared to some games. More of a chaotic simulation feel, which I like, though also with a fun/gamey/dark-humorous flavor.<br>* Details of ammo/equipment management, but not too much.<br><br>One great thing I didn't expect is the Defend The Base mode, which lets you set up a base and try to defend it against increasingly stronger waves of aliens, with damage details (including spilled fuel and acid and so on) being carried over, and limited resources to repair or re-arrange things, and an option to retreat rather than hold once the position seems untennable. Nice!<br><br>Also, the game is still in development and the developer is listening and adding some things that players have asked for, which is awesome, and in my very long experience with games, is what makes for the best games. For example, one thing that was jarring to me was the firing arcs of some weapons, which were limited during one's own turn to firing along straight or diagonal grid lines, which the developer had an interesting intention for doing, but which seemed unnatural to me (in contrast to the way most of the rest of the game works in ways I would expect, in nice detail, in fact). Turns out in response to player comments, they are working for an option to not do that, for players who don't want it, which may be in the next patch. Sweet!<br><br>I have a few gripes but nothing major. The odd firing arcs of some weapons was probably my biggest nitpick. The looting and inventory manipulation can be a bit fiddly but it hasn't bothered me too much yet, and I quite appreciate all the detail and choices. I could even wish it were more fiddly, as I find the recycler and manufacturing of new items during the campaign is very generous and I'd be interested to have to make do more with what I find. (Though without the recycler/manufacturer the lack of storage slots would become an issue.) Mainly I'd just like more of the same. I expect I will eventually have had enough for a while and wish for another campaign, but for now I'm happily hooked.<br><br>Anyway, I quite recommend Ultimate Space Commando!					<div class="gradient"></div>

					A surprisingly well made game. It doesn't have high production values, as you can see from the screenshots. But it's enough to get you into the setting and convey the information you need.<br><br>The gameplay seems well balanced so far. Though the tutorial does start you with far less ammunition than you would want. It allows a lot of customization in terms of what kinds of weapons you want on your squad, and what other support equipment. And specialization of your characters into different roles.<br><br>Destructable terrain and explosives play heavily into the tactics. It becomes very important to set up your fights so they take place in the right area. But even so, it doesn't feel like a game where &quot;one mistake costs you the game&quot;, which is one of my least favorite of the xcom alike mechanics.<br><br>					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Before you read on, make sure you realize I'm only roughly two hours in.<br><br>This is a yes and a no in my book. I really don't think this should be marked as a &quot;full release&quot; yet. There are a few reasons why.<br><br>There are a few minor (but noticable) spelling and grammar mistakes, along with a lack of continuity, at least where I got in the campign (which is barely past the tutorial). A character has the rank of (in their panel) Petty Officer, but is addressed as a Corporal by a Lieutenant. What? Did the writers not agree somewhere?<br><br>The basic gameplay and mechanics is more or less XCOM, but in space. If you've played XCOM, you've played this game. There isn't anything I've seen so far that sets it apart, although this is subjec to change.<br><br>What I <i> don't </i> like is the fact that you're stuck with character names for the campign. While I guess it makes sense, it also puts up a barrier between the player and the game, because they aren't able to relate as well with characters the dev's named, in this sort of game at least.<br><br>There are also no animations, in regards to movement and attacking. It's sliding around on the screen, with sound effects. The first thing I thought of, was ToME, in regards to it. Games like that can get away with it, because they're cheaper. At least very minor ones would be nice, for a game that is charging $20 (keep in mind I bought this at $15) to play. Not that it's terrible how it is, it's just kinda a mild annoyance.<br><br>It also suffers from the same annoying &quot;multiplayer&quot; that some other indie games do. The one that is inputting an IP address, and hoping it connects. Unless you know somebody who can port-forward every day, or some shell server, you won't be getting on multiplayer, as there is no server browser or even a quick-match service.<br><br>With the rather hefty price tag in mind, unless things get patched and added for the game, this isn't a game you should pick up if you have played games such the older (or newer) XCOM. If it is on sale for $10-13, maybe. $5, then without a doubt pick it up. At the normal price of $20, you could do much better.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					I've been playing USC since Beta and I find it a very complex, elaborated and pleasantly old-school game. My favourite modes are &quot;Single Mission&quot; and &quot;Defend the Base!&quot;, because my team can do very well and I can play with it in both modes.  I'm very excited for my team to survive especially when a Wunderwurm attacks us.<br><br>And you can distribute skill points to set up your units for different roles (medic, heavy, technician, etc.). You have certain amount of credits, which sometimes makes it a challenge to buy everything you need, but this also makes the game very exciting.<br><br>In &quot;Defend the Base!&quot; mode you have to make sure that you use everything you can, because each wave is stronger and stronger (e.g. having turrets is very useful). It is also very good that you can repair your base and build new rooms or walls - between the waves.<br><br>I recommend this game for everyone who likes complex tactics with a lot of possibilities and high stakes (and being bullied by a worm, after you survived dozens of reapers).<br>					<div class="gradient"></div>

					Steamified Â» Indie Spotlight Â» Ultimate Space Commando: Turn-based Tactics in Space<br>Ultimate Space Commando: Turn-based Tactics in Space<br>  BY STEAMIFIED APRIL 12, 2016 INDIE SPOTLIGHT<br>Indie Spotlight: Ultimate Space Commando<br>Indie Spotlight: Ultimate Space Commando<br><br><br>Developer	Creatio 49	Publisher	Angry Cat Ltd.<br>Release Date	13 May, 2015	Genre	Indie, RPG, Strategy, Turn-based Tactics<br>Official Website	Twitter	Facebook	Steam<br>STEAMIFIED IN A NUTSHELL<br>Ultimate Space Commando marks the Steam debut of Creatio 49. Itâs a turn-based tactics game that has been set in the era of early interstellar colonization. Youâre looking at a small indie teamâs attempt to enter the same genre as the XCOM franchise among others. Somewhat surprisingly their take on the genre is more polished and enjoyable than I thought that it was going to be. Similar to other games within the genre, players have the opportunity to customize four-troop squads with weapons, ammunition and tools. While the core of the gameplay is turn-based there is a well implemented RPG-style management system.<br><br>There is a lengthy campaign mode which I have yet to complete but I can tell you that it is immersive and is soundly designed. The basis of the campaign is controlling the fate of the crew of the U.S.C. ship Wraith which is a recon vessel stranded on an isolated mining planet. Itâs your a typical first contact scenario that, of course, poses the greatest risk to the survival of humanity. There are over thirty missions â of varying length â within the campaign â so to suggest that there are many hours worth of content within the campaign alone would be considered an understatement.<br><br>A fantastic touch by the developers was making the combat environment fully interactive. What this feature actually does is enable a superior level of strategy than would otherwise be possible. The interactive environments work hand in hand with the deep combat mechanics and squad management tools. Incorporated into the combat system are four statistics that are all of significant importance â health, morale, action points and armor as well as nine attributes that have essentially been stripped from an RPG game. The amount of weapon types (18) and gadgets (30+) help make the game one of the deepest strategy games that Iâve ever played. It all works exceedingly well and although it may lack the polish of an XCOM it is well and truly worth your time if you are in any way enamored with the genre. If youâre not then the earlier levels will serve as a great learning tool for the game.<br><br>Of course, there are further game modes beyond the campaign including defend the base and an almost limitless single mission structure where the size of the map, difficulty, player handicaps, the objectives and more are all able to be customized. My personal favorite game mode, even ranking it ahead of the great campaign, is the defend the base mode. In this mode you have to build your base while incorporating resource management and survive wave after wave of alien attacks.<br><br>There are trading cards to be harvested and multiplayer availability. Unfortunately the developers are yet to incorporate Steam achievements into their game but their definitely is the potential of them being added. In regards to the multiplayer game there was a season one competitive mode. Season two is being planned but the developers are hoping to get a larger player base so that they can make that even more challenging and engaging than the exciting first season. Iâm certain that Lt. Commander Bozdo will be back to defend his crown.<br><br>Ultimate Space Commander is one of the deepest games that weâve covered to date. Iâm certain that Iâve only just scratched the surface of what is available to players and as such Steamified wholeheartedly recommends it.<br><br>For more reviews and our popular giveaways please visit <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.steamified.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >http://www.steamified.com</a>.					<div class="gradient"></div>

					<b>Short Version:</b>  Ultimate Space Commando is a turn-based tactical rpg/strategy game that is completely old school in both good and bad ways:  unique, intricate game mechanisms with lots of meat, but also extremely slow-moving and unforgiving gameplay.  If you find yourself enjoying it, I believe you could easily get dozens (or hundreds) of hours out of this game.  Conversely, it could easily take you dozens (or hundreds) of hours to try and get your enjoyment out of this game, which modern gamers may not have the patience for.  Likely you will either love it or hate it - this is a niche game to the extreme.<br><br>Ultimate Space Commando is a massive game stuffed to the brim with a large campaign and tons of content in the other game modes along with richly complex gameplay mechanisms supporting them.  The developer clearly has put much love and effort into this project, which shows both in the game as well as their online presence - they appear to be extraordinarily active and helpful in the forums as well as the enormous (and necessary) online guide for the game.  <br><br>In the game, you take your squad of Ultimate Space Commandos into the depths of a harrowing alien world, inhabited by countless hostile aliens that bear a striking resemblance to... well, 'Alien'.  The dark, foreboding atmosphere lit only by your active scanners and field of vision sets a perfect stage for your wary approach into the unknown, where monsters may suddenly swarm you or even start chewing through the walls to get to your tasty team. The gameplay itself is rather enjoyable, with every action needing to be carefully planned out to best make use of your extremely limited action points, ammo, randomly obtained gear, and the uniquely developed skill-sets of your party.<br><br>Alas, with all these wonderful things going for it, I still cannot recommend the game in its current state.  As much as I want to like Ultimate Space Commando... the game feels like an Early Access version to me, rather than a fully finished product. This is mainly due to the incredibly slow pacing of the game and the presence of at least one gamebreaking bug.<br><br>Turn-based strategy games are usually slow by design, as you must plan out every single movement to efficiently win battles.  However, with 4 separate characters, each with many actions per turn - and dozens of enemies on screen with the same - battles in Ultimate Space Commando can last for aaaages.  The painful inventory management slows down the action even more, as four distinct 9-slot inventories must be carefully arranged and rearranged with all the scraps and items you find.  <br><br>As for the bugs... let me set the stage.   Imagine that you are a member of an undergeared and overwhelmed elite fighting squad, who has found a brief respite from the action by jamming into a tiny elevator car only big enough for the 4 of you.<br><br><i>  The tension builds as the transport creeps down to what may very well be your doom.  As the doors finally open, acid-drooling alien monstrosities swarm you from all directions, and you bust out the big guns, fighting through the endless swarm for hours.  You slowly go through your extra inventory, throwing grenades and popping medkits, and the end seems to be in sight.  BUT THEN, aliens break through the wall near your poor, weaksauce technician, swarming him unexpectedly.  A messy death follows shortly after.  <br><br>As you prepare to enter the afterlife... lo and behold you instead find yourself BACK in the elevator, jammed into a tiny car only big enough for the 4 of you.  The tension builds as the transport creeps down to what may very well be your doom.  As the doors finally... wait, what?  The doors won't open???? EVER????   You mean.... we're stuck in this elevator for eternity, with no other save points to go back to???? Nooooooooooooooooooooo!  </i><br><br>Yup.  That happened.  <br><br>In a very long game that relies on a single auto-save to keep the feeling that your past actions matter (*see edit*), gamebreaking bugs like this can be pretty frustrating.  I also experienced a couple of game crashes on loading levels (although my save files were still fine in those instances).  From the forums, it appears things like crashes and unending levels have happened to others as well, though not frequently and the developer seems very quick to patch them out.<br><br>--<b>(EDIT:</b> *The developer pointed out that players can enable an option that allows an extra backup save.  I would highly recommend this, even with the in-game restriction of having your campaign labeled as a 'training drill'.)<br><br>The campaign's narration could also use that final bit of polish that takes it to the level of a $20 game. The story of the game seems rather well done, but... the actual words used to convey the story?  Not so much.  While reading sentences that sometimes lack punctuation or need to be rearranged to make sense does have its own special retro charm, putting the game script into the hands of an editor would probably be a good idea.  This mild lack of editing just adds to the feel that the game hasn't quite made it to the final release (though to be fair, this can easily be overlooked in favor of the incredibly deep gameplay).<br><br>In the end... I still see huge potential in this game, and strategy fans may find endless hours of entertainment in USC's immense, immersive world - especially with the outstanding community events the developer has hosted.  If this were an Early Access title I would definitely give it a thumbs up...however, I just can't bring myself to fully recommend it as a finished product.  I wholeheartedly hope that Ultimate Space Commando will do well and keep getting patched to smooth out the experience, but right now you may need to be a very patient gamer to get the most out of this so-close-to-amazing game.  <br><br><blockquote class="bb_blockquote">Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.
