desc_long							评测						“Analogue is a sit-up-and-take-notice achievement in storytelling, in interface, in research, in mechanics and in moral ambiguity.”– Alec Meer, Rock Paper Shotgun“It was like watching a horror movie, knowing what was about to happen and curious only how awful the director’s willing to get. Love is not gratuitous but doesn’t disappoint – the fate of the Mugunghwa, and the event that precipitated it, is as valid as it is appalling.”– Matt Sakey, Tap-Repeatedly													最新更新									Now includes the Science and Tradition DLCIncludes two new costumes for the cosplaying AI *Hyun-ae: a scientist's lab coat, and the traditional hanbok that the Pale Bride wore.																						关于这款游戏							Back in the 25th century, Earth launched a generation ship into deep space, with the goal of establishing the first interstellar colony. It dropped out of contact and disappeared, never reaching its destination.
