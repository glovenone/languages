desc_long							评测						“Thumbs up!”Jim Sterling“a really well designed game with a bright future.”Caffeine Crew												关于这款游戏							UNLOVED is based on the community award-winning mod for Doom2 with the same name by the same creator. UNLOVED is a strange place. A twisted reality. A nightmare that comes to life. A place where demons and abhorrent monsters manifest and possess the living with only one goal: to end you. Nothing wants you here. And there is no way out. Only the elevator that leads further and further down into the darkness of your insanity.Play alone or in a group of up to 4 players and explore the endless amount of basement levels that are procedurally arranged every time you enter. Work as a team, open new areas, find weapon-mods, solve personal challenges, complete level objectives and unlock new skills to survive this trip into the unknown.Main FeaturesRandomly arranged LevelsEvery basement area is generated from hand crafted level chunks that are randomly arranged. After that, certain areas get locked by the "Architect" and you have to find certain key items to access them. Maps can have different sizes and special end rooms with objectives that have to be solved to complete the level.Fast Paced Shooter Gameplay + Coop FeaturesThe game resurrects the old-school fast paced action shooter gameplay. Combined with deadly monsters and modern coop-features that encourage playing in a team to stay alive in a harsh and deadly environment. Find and join other players online or play via LAN. If you don't feel like playing in a team, you can play alone just as well.Create your own unique Persona and Play-StyleBesides customizing your appearance, you can also create your own unique play-style. Equip magic trinkets with unique powers that can completely change the way you experience the game. Want to become super tough, or do you prefer to run super fast? Do you want to deal lots of damage, or have the highest chances of survival? The right combination of trinkets makes it possible and sets you apart from other players.Find Weapon-Mods to be more efficientEvery weapon can be upgraded with special mods. These can alter the way a weapon functions in dramatic ways. They may change the way the weapon operates, increase fire rate or give boosts like speed reloading.Gain Karma by completing personal ChallengesYou don't just get experience points for killing monsters. Each time you play, certain challenges are given to you. If you fulfill your personal objectives, you get Karma points that you can spend to upgrade your Persona.Unlock new Items and the Mysteries that UNLOVED holdsWithin the levels are different mysterious objects scattered. By collecting them, you can later unlock new player customization items, trinkets and pieces of information that may or may not have clues about this unearthly realm of insanity.
