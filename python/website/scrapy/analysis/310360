desc_long							评测						“Nearly everything about this game’s story just works. It leans from the most asinine, youthful banter possible to truly twisted mental states by the end. Players will end up second guessing themselves just as much as the protagonist does.”4.5/5 – Hardcore Gamer“Higurashi stands out as an example of how evocative a game can be based on storytelling without the aid of high-end graphics.”8.5/10 – APG Nation												关于这款游戏							*THE GAME THAT INSPIRED THE MEGA-HIT ANIME SERIES RETURNS WITH BRAND NEW CHARACTER ART!! *----------------------------------------------------------------------------The 58th year of Shouwa, early summerIt’s June, and the summer heat has arrived earlier than it does most years.By day there are crickets, and by night there are cicadas.We’re in Hinamizawa, a small village in the countryside.There are fewer than two thousand people here. But every year, there is an event.This event is a mysterious death.(The series has run from 1979 to 1983)On a certain day in June, someone dies, and someone else goes missing.The series of deaths is connected to the upheaval surrounding the dam construction project.A murder case that was covered up is being reenacted.Is it a conspiracy? A coincidence? Or perhaps a curse?Someone who was supposed to be there isn’t.Someone who wasn’t supposed to be there is.Someone who was alive last night is dead now.And someone who is here right now isn’t alive.So, there is no way to avert tragedy. There is no choice but to give up.But don’t give up.Only you can stand up to this.
