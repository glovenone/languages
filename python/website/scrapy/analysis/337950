The Skies is a free-to-play first-person MMORPG blending in shooter elements and set in an open-world post-apocalyptic environment. Players will experience complete freedom and be able to forge their own path via a fully customizable role system and a non-linear quest system. Player choice will influence not only their own development and interactions, but also other players' representation of the game world.”http://news.mmosite.com/content/2016-04-04/eforb_prepares_to_launch_their_survival_mmorpg_the_skies_via_steam_early_access.shtml“Quickly getting the thumbs up on Steam Greenlight and generating chatter at IndieDb, The Skies seemed ready to claim its niche.”http://www.mmorpg.com/mobile/features.cfm?from=home&read=10722&ismb=1“Steam Greenlight is a great thing. It’s a system that gives independent video game developers a chance at having their game be released on Steam. With enough support from fans and the community, the game can be a part of the Steam library.  One game that looks promising is The Skies, a post-apocalyptic MMORPG with a non-linear storyline from Ukrainian studio EFORB. The game is said to be a mix of DayZ and Fallout 3. As for the RPG side of things, as you’ll be able to create your own role and your own reality.”http://nerdreactor.com/2014/11/26/the-skies-mmorpg-shooter/													Early Alpha has launched									Some time ago we've seen huge support from our Steam community, have passed Greenlight just for few days, received lots of positive feedback, lots of kind, encouraging words and your thumbs up.
