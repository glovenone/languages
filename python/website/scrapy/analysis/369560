From combat enhancements to new ways of traversing puzzles, items in The Story goes On are laid out to work with each other and grant the player cool item combinations every time they play.

Randomly Generated WorldsA majority of the game’s combat and worlds are randomly generated per play-through.  While the overarching story remains constant, the player will discover it in their own way.Story-Based Pre-Built DungeonsInside every randomly generated world is a matching pre-made dungeon that introduces new mechanics, enemies and story elements into the main game.  From transforming into a ghost to navigate a haunted mansion, to riding a bling’d out minecart to freedom, you find these locations hidden in the worlds, concealed by puzzles.
