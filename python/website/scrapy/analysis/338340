The basics are simple, the duels take only a few minutes and there are hundreds of different cards which can be leveled and evolutionized. So tons of possibilities the create a perfect deck without investing any money ever.”7.7 – Hardbloxx“Nightbanes features a great setting, superlative card artwork and rules that are easy to understand. There is more than enough variety when it comes to cards to keep things interesting and the multitude of play modes are also a bonus. Best of all, the game is completely free to play, so there is no excuse not to give it a chance. You can drop some cash to purchase booster packs or cards, but with enough time and dedication you can still have plenty of fun without spending a cent.”8.7 – Gameramble“With all that I have yet to experience, I’m beyond excited to see everything else this killer CCG has to offer. If you love CCGs like I do, you must check out Nightbanes on Steam; since it’s free-to-play, you’ve got nothing to lose. This is a seriously great game with a lot to offer fans of this genre, and it’s out NOW! See you on the battlefield!”GamerAssaultWeekly												关于这款游戏							Nightbanes is a digital collectible card game set in an alternate modern horror universe where vampire clans are waging an endless war for dominance.Conquer the underworld as an almighty vampire lord by sending your minions and allies into battle. Duel other lords in different PvP modes or master the single player campaign earning additional powerful cards the further you journey.Step into modern, urban battlegrounds filled with magic and gruesome creatures. Fight werewolves - your traditional archenemies - as well as horrifying monsters, wild animals, corrupted humans, and even battle robots, aliens and dragons from a portal to medieval times.Build your deck according to your preferred play style and theme. Run bestial decks that overrun your opponent with the pure mass of creatures, build up a defensive deck and hide behind your lines while slowly draining your opponent’s life, or take control of the battle with powerful artifacts – the choice is yours!Earn cards along your journey or pull them from booster packs to constantly improve your deck. Cards can be leveled and combined to create new, more powerful additions to your deck – something a real world card game can never deliver.As you fight your way through different thematically regions and themes you’ll battle powerful bosses, found guilds and join-up with other players to raid the most merciless epic bosses of the underworld in order to gain special loot cards. The universe of Nightbanes is an ever-growing one with new expansions, abilities and hundreds of new cards to be introduced over time. Take your strategies to the next level in the player-versus-player part of the game. In active PvP, players need to be simultaneously online and fight a live duel to gain a higher ranking. The higher your PvP rating (under the ELO system) the more PvP reward cards unlock. Every PvP season lasts about 2-3 months.After a season the PvP rankings are reset and new reward cards added. Players also earn a currency called "Blood badges" which they can spend on special PvP cards.Gain even more blood badges in passive PvP: You submit your deck but you don't have to be online. You either fight against offline players or the AI takes over your deck if you are attacked.Also check out Nightbanes' Wiki website, powered by Gamepedia, for further in-depth information about cards, enemies, tactics and more.
