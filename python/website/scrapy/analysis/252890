desc_long							评测						“It's heavy on story, atmosphere, and puzzles! Not a standard hidden object or casual adventure game, Dracula: Love Kills builds a bridge between genres and provides a puzzle-centric experience that plays less like a hidden object game and more like a puzzle game with a narrative.  A good length from start to finish, plenty of things to unlock/achieve, a story you actually want to take part in, and puzzles built around a hidden object/adventure core, Dracula: Love Kills is an excellent addition to any casual gamer's library.”4.4 out of 5 – Jayisgames“There's lots of top-notch hidden object searching, plenty of puzzle solving and finally, for once, a chance to play the bad guy as a really bad guy. That alone is almost worth the price of admission, and Dracula: Love Kills is definitely worth a look.”4 out of 5 – Gamezebo“This game proves that a classic tale told with refreshing twists, diverse protagonists who play off each other's discrete personalities, a vast repository of thoughtful challenges, moral dilemmas yielding different outcomes, and impressive art and architecture will produce a winner irrespective of the format. It has both style and substance, and is worth playing at least a couple of times for all fans of vampires and/or casual adventure games.”AadventureGamers												关于这款游戏							The Queen of Vampires emerges from the ashes of history, seeking to destroy the world of humans and rule over its ruins!
