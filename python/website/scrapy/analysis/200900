It succeeds at telling a great story, providing fantastic run-and-gun gameplay, and a huge world to explore, and it does so with a style and technique all its own.”95/100 – http://www.destructoid.com/review-cave-story-wiiware--169033.phtml						“It's a must-play masterpiece for anyone who like classic action games -- or any kind of action game, really. The only real question is which will amaze you more: That this is the work of a single man, or that they actually do make 'em like this anymore.”100/100 – http://www.1up.com/reviews/cave-story-wii-review						“If this game had been released on the NES 20 years ago, it would be recalled by a generation of players as a high point of the 8-bit era.”90/100 – Eurogamer												关于这款游戏							Arguably the most well-known indie game of all time, Cave Story features a completely original storyline wrapped with personality, mystery and hours of fast-paced fun. Cave Story is an action-adventure game from the critically acclaimed independent designer, Daisuke Amaya--or Pixel to his fans. Overflowing with unmatched charm and character, Cave Story takes you into a rare world where a curious race of innocent rabbit-like creatures, called Mimigas, run free.						You wake up in a dark cave with no memory of who you are, where you came from or why you're in such a place. Uncovering Mimiga Village you discover that the once-carefree Mimigas are in danger at the hands of a maniacal scientist. The Mimigas’ only hope rest squarely on the shoulders of a quiet, amnesiac boy who can't remember his own name.						Run, jump, shoot, fly and explore your way through a massive action-adventure reminiscent of classic 8- and 16-bit games. Take control and learn the origins of this world’s power, stop the delusional villain and save the Mimiga!						Key Features:						Original (320x240) graphics and upgraded “HD” graphics						Remastered music as well as the original soundtrack						Mix-and-match new/old artwork and music!						Six new play modes (including Wind Fortress, Boss Rush and more!)						Over 20 epic boss battles through Mimiga Island						15 levels to explore in the vast world						10 unique weapons to find and upgrade						USB controller compatibility						Four unique endings						Future content updates
