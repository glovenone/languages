Aiming to take this concept to new dimensions is Tethys Interactive’s Astral Terra.”IndieGameMag“Morrowind meets Minecraft; that’s my first impression looking at this open-world 3D aRPG. The graphics are nicer than in either of these games, but it still manages to implement Minecraft’s world creation and destruction mechanics. That it does so in a truly alien-looking, open-ended fantasy world reminiscent of The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind is icing on the proverbial cake.”Indie RPGs“With the constantly changing worlds there is no limit to the wonders that Astral Terra can provide. It’s rare that a game truly leaves me in awe of what they’re doing. Astral Terra is getting to that point. The thought of ever-changing worlds, that I can change on a whim is very intriguing. I hope it lives up to its potential.”Two Dash Stash												关于这款游戏							Unlimited Terraforming and Building in your own Procedurally GeneratedSmooth Voxel World.Explore, Adventure, Craft, Build, Survive.

The Firstborn was enigmatic.They named him Davanu, and tall and proud,Crowned with mighty horns and lusting always for power.Red is his color.Next in their line was Da’lea the Green, joyful and merciful,Prone to rapid change in mood, but mighty in her generosity and mirth.Finally, in a pregnancy that nearly killed Lakana were born the Four:Ravanyx the Golden, fiery in both temperament and appearance;Vaya the color of Sky, fast and effortless in motion, controlled by none;Nitluru the Brown, dwarfed and sturdy, slow to anger, but mighty in wrath;And Tagaryl, green like the Sea, cold and deep, filled with secrets...Read more and learn all about Planar Wardens and Astral Terra at our wiki!
