desc_long							评测						"CastleStorm draws from a seemingly unmanageable array of inspirations including real-time strategy, tower defense, and Angry Birds, and does so with remarkable virtuosity and humor." 8/10--IGN"CastleStorm doesn't try to hide its inspirations, and it doesn't need to. There are enough of them to morph this action strategy into something fresh and exciting. It's warm, frequently funny, and stylish It's just hard enough to keep you biting. And most of all, it's just bloody great."  9/10--OXM UK“In what is easily one of the greatest moments of my gaming career, I once used my ballista to shoot a dragon out of the sky. The massive lizard corpse fell to the ground, killing three of my opponent’s soldiers. Thank you for making that moment possible, Zen Studios."  83/100--VentureBeat													Steam Big Picture																															关于这款游戏							Welcome to the world of CastleStorm, a super genre mashup of 2D physics destruction mashed with tower defense brawler!
