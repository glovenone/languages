It came out of a successful Kickstarter and Greenlight adventure. Since No Time To Explain, we started helping other developers with their games. After getting enough muscle behind our internal studio, we came back to No Time To Explain, and completely remade the game in a proper engine. No Time To Explain Remastered is free for everyone who owns the original!
