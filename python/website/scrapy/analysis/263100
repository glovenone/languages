desc_long							评测						“It’s beautiful. It’s tear-jerking. Simply writing about it does not do it justice.”5/5 – TwoDashStash“9.03m’s quiet approach exposes the limitations of “character development” and reflects adult experience. But the most powerful part of 9.03m is its ending. How many times can we say that about a video game?”10/10 – Fate of the Game“It’s moving, it’s gorgeous, and if you don’t have the feels yet, you’ll get them. I won’t say any more, but 9.03m‘s ending will stick with you for a long time.”Jetpack Joust													Steam 青睐之光																															关于这款游戏							9.03m, is a short, first person, art/empathy game for PC. Not a game in the traditional sense of the word; it aims to humanise, and remember the victims of the 2011 Japanese tsunami. The media is quick to put figures to death tolls in such disasters, and 9.03m tries to remind people of the individuals behind those figures. 9.03m is set on Baker Beach in San Francisco, where debris from the tsunami has washed ashore in the years following the tsunami. To play, you must find the butterflies. All royalties (as of 19/12/2013) are donated to charity. Half of all received Space Budgie royalties go to Aid For Japan (http://www.aidforjapan.org.uk), a charity that helps children who lost their parents in the tsunami. The other half goes to Redr (http://www.redr.org.uk) a charity that helps in disaster scenarios.
