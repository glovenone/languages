The graphics are pretty, the music is awesome, and it felt appropriately difficult on its own merit rather than me fighting the system. I’ve got little but praise for this game and felt it worth the price.”Approved! (they dont score) – Indie Gamer Chick													Steam 青睐之光																															关于这款游戏							Aqua Kitty is a fast paced retro styled submarine arcade shooter with optional 2 player local Co-op.Blast through hordes of mechanical sea monsters in your kitty sub and defend the deep sea milk mining kittens!THE MILK MUST FLOW!StoryDue to a sudden shortage of milk, cats around the world are forced to seek out new sources to get their fix.You and your team of milk mining kittens have overcome a fear of water to drill down under the ocean seabed and begin extracting vast reserves of what seems to be naturally forming full-fat milk.Get ready for fast paced submarine action, defending the kittens from disruptive mechanical sea creatures.Key FeaturesOptional 2 player local CO-OP.Branching map progression of levels.3 Main Game Campaign ModesNormal Mode - the standard game of branching levels full of mechanical enemies with differing behaviours.Easy Mode - a version of Normal mode in case you found it too hard, with more health and easier enemies.Arcade Mode - a special survival mode where you must collect gems to purchase powerups.Depth based power-up systems which gives partial control on the type and location of the power-ups created (allowing tactical advantage).Classic infinite mode milk-free level, that never ever ends - for the hardcore challenge.Dual firing submarine with a rechargeable secondary weapon that needs to be managed carefully (upgrades through game progress in Easy and Normal Modes, but upgrades via a shop system in Arcade Mode).Varying sea depths per level which subtly affect gameplay.Chain kill combo system allowing the more skilled player to maximise score.Steam online leaderboards to challenge and achievements to obtain.Hand drawn pixel art graphics, displayed at a crisp 720p.Awesome chiptune music taking inspiration from the best of the C64 and Amiga days.Development historyHello, here is a short history of this indie games' development which we hope will be of interest.Aqua Kitty was made by a core team of two people with audio created by Electric Cafe and the game box art by artist David Hankin.It began as a small modern-retro styled PC game, designed to run at a crisp 1280x720 it was created with a love of the 16bit gaming era and late 80s video arcade games.There are 3 core versions of the game available of different hardware - PC, XBox360 and Sony PSM.Sony version is the oldest and smallest version. A critically acclaimed launch title for PSM (Vita).XBox version is the Sony version with extra added levels + enemies + refinements.PC version is the most feature rich and improves on the XBox one with new Weapons + Gradius style Arcade mode + yet further refinements and extra details (with the Steam version being unique in having online leaderboards and achievements).All the new things we have added to the Steam version will also be rolled back into the other PC versions unless Steam specific (ie Online leaderboards, achievements, trading cards are STEAM ONLY).
