desc_long								关于这款游戏							WHAT IS DOOM & DESTINY ADVANCED?Doom and Destiny Advanced is a hilarious IRPG (italian role-playing game... 'cause we are from Italy) where you control the destiny of four nerds through an epic journey in an unpredictable fantasy world.Do&De Adv is the sequel, prequel and reboot of Doom & Destiny. It features a huge world map, awesome action-packed turn base combat, crazy party customization, talkative npcs, cross-platform multiplayer, secrets, gags, nerdy jokes and an ever-expanding storyline!WAIT WHAT? SEQUEL, PREQUEL AND REBOOT?Oh yes! It's a "sequel" because it's the second installment of the "Doom and Destiny series". The four nerds from Do&De are back for some epic rpg action! It's a "prequel" because it's set in a timeline preceding the events of Doom & Destiny, BUT it's also a "reboot" because while using the same premise and the four main characters, a similar world and some characters from Doom & Destiny, it tells a brand new story set in a different timeline and even dimension than Doom & Destiny. Much like the "Zelda" series has been doing in the past 20 years :D So don't be afraid if you haven't played Doom & Destiny! You'll be able to fully enjoy this game by it self, but if you played Do&De, you'll enjoy it even more!WHY ON EARLY ACCESS?Role playing games are HUGE and we want to do things right!The first time, with Do&De, we were 2 smelly dweebs in a basement making the rpg of our dreams.But this time we washed ourselves, used deodorant and now we want to create an even bigger and better adventure! YOUR help can make this happen since YOUR support and ideas can make this game grow and become awesome!Buying the Early Access of Doom & Destiny Advanced you'll be able to play the game right from its glorious beta state AND get the full game and all its updates once it will be ready!OK, COOL, SO WHAT'S NEW IN DO&DE ADVANCED?Custom made graphic, music and game mechanics (this is for who played Do&De)!15 hours of brand new comical and ever-expanding storyline!Huge world to explore filled with secrets, fun lore and crazy monsters!Full freedom of hero's stats customization at each level up!15 Classes (and more to come!) to change the role of each nerd: from wizard to sorcerer, from thief to cook!22 Cosplays!
