desc_long							评测						“Long story short: it's really awesome.”4/5 – TouchArcade“If Shadow of the Colossus had been made by Ikea, it might look like this.”8/10 – EuroGamer“The bottom line: David presents an abstract, dangerous world that’s as tough as it is beautiful and surprisingly emotive.”4.5/5 – Mac|Life												关于这款游戏							SummaryDavid is a game. A game about physics and enemies. A game about struggles and life. A game about David.This game is designed to be difficult. I poured myself into developing this game for nights and nights and nights. It's almost tough to share. I hope it feels strangely personal.DescriptionYou play David, an awfully small abstracted chosen hero tossed into a blissfully simple world overrun by giant culminations of evil physics-beasts. As David, you are given a slingshot-esque gift that you will have to use to conquer your colossus foes. Hold, aim, and fling to attack (Angry Birds™ style!).Featuresa 9-level Campaign, 3 Additional Levels, a Survival/Arena/RPG mode, a Secret Basket-ball-pit Minigame, and hats!SoundtrackA six song EP soundtrack is included with purchase "...that feels like FEZ and is similarly wonderful!" - Laser Dog
