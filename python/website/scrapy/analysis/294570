If you have never before tried any of the Humongous products, then you are in for a pleasant surprise, and you may find yourself sneaking to the computer once your child is sound asleep.”100 – Just Adventure“I played with Clare for a lot of this game, not because she needed me to, but because we both wanted to. At 8 years old she would certainly be in the top end of the target audience, and my input into what to do next was negligible. She was able to work her way through all the conundrums, with only the occasional nudge. She thought that the game was "just right" as far as the challenges were concerned.”100 – Quandary“This adventure game provides kids with plenty of opportunities to develop problem-solving skills as they sleuth their way through a colorful underwater world.”92 – Review Corner													Humongous Tees Now Available!
