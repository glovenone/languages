It almost feels like a lost Castlevania game from the NES era that was recently unearthed.”4.5/5 – Hardcore Gamer“The side-scrolling 2D 8-bit graphics are perfectly crafted in an open world with a storyline that is fairly attractive. With over fifteen hours worth of gameplay, you can’t go wrong with this title.”8.5/10 – 3rd Strike“A great writer of the past and a great developer of the future have come together and created something memorable. Now that’s a legacy.”5/5 – Invision Game Community												关于这款游戏							The Waste Land, inspired by T.S.
