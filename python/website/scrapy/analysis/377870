Cinematic and grandiose, the hypnotic flow of its stages and the dynamism of your weaponry is only upstaged by its set-piece bosses. From giant mechanised crabs and hulking sea turtles to formidable stingrays, swordfish and golden lobsters, each battle is positively majestic.”Recommended – Eurogamer“DariusBurst Chronicle Saviours is the best entry in the storied shoot ‘em up genre in years.”4/5 – We Got This Covered“A slice of heaven for shmup fans everywhere. Controller support, Steam cloud saves, 3000+ stages, 4 play co-op support, dual monitor and wide screen support and much much more.
