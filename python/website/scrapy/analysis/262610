Liquid Rhythm v1.4.5 features full compatibility with Cycling '74's Max 7.http://www.wavedna.com/liquid-rhythm-updated-version-1-4-5/																						关于这款软件							Liquid Rhythm is a wildly innovative beat generator, sequencer, and software MIDI controller. It's powered by a rhythm synthesis engine that gives you instant access to quadrillions of rhythmic patterns that can be manipulated with a comprehensive suite of MIDI effects called Molecule Tools. Paint drum patterns using a palette of note clusters that provide new visualizations for MIDI data, make beats using multi-sample drum instruments or your own samples, and run it standalone or integrate into your workflow through VST/AU/RTAS/Max for Live.Key FeaturesAccent ModifiersAccent Modifiers target the velocity and groove of notes; basically the things that make music not sound like renegade robots hijacked your studio and started making music. You can think of Accent Modifiers as avenues to humanize your beats and free them from totalitarian robotic rule.BeatBuilder: BarForm ListWhen you’re creating a drum track, the Beat Builder is your best friend. By default, it’s a really straightforward look at some commonly occurring patterns for whatever instrument you have selected. For example, if you’re working on a snare instrument, the Beat Builder will instantly highlight snare-specific patterns you can insert into regions with one click.BeatBuilder: BeatForm SequencerA regular sequencer loops one or two bars and you input notes one at a time. The BeatForm Sequencer takes that model to the next level:  Each space in the sequencer can hold one or more notes, up to six. You can think of the spaces in the BeatForm sequencer as placeholders for groups of notes. All it ever takes is one click in the BeatForm Sequencer to get a cluster of notes in any given space.  BeatSeekerThe BeatWeaver Rhythm Synthesizer can be an intimidating mass of information to negotiate through. That’s why the developers at WaveDNA built the BeatSeeker, an intelligent algorithm that highlights the most commonly occurring patterns for whatever instrument you’re working on. Our team of astute scientists studied several hundred songs from a variety of genres to ensure its accuracy. In-Line EditingLiquid Rhythm’s Pencil and Paint tools turn the Arranger into something it should always be– a Canvas. Rhythm is art, your screen is an easel, and these are the tools of your trade.Media LibraryLiquid Rhythm features a handful of  distinct kits, each mapped to the General MIDI standard of percussion (which is a fancy way of saying that when you hook up your MIDI drum pad, everything will work just the way you’d expect it to). There are six electronic kits:DnBDubstepHipHopHouseTechnoTrance ...and four acoustic kits: AcousticPopRockSoul The Music MoleculeThe Music Molecule is a new representation of MIDI. More importantly, it’s a simpler and more musical representation of MIDI. Unlike traditional MIDI editors, Liquid Rhythm doesn’t require you to have any theoretical understanding of music or the piano. It’s our way of grouping notes together in a 4/4 bar to let you actually paint entire bars of music onto your arranger. VST/AU/RTASIntegrate Liquid Rhythm into your studio setup using our VST/AU/RTAS plugins. Check out http://www.wavedna.com/daw-videos/ for more compatibility details!
