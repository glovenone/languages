Sathenu found Daeron's weapon and broke it into relics and scattered them around Time. Then he created an ancient organization to protect these relics, and two Artifacts for anyone to travel back in time, if the world is in crisis again. The Guardians of Time were the protectors of these relics. Then, thousands of years later into the future, Nrutas, an orphan, realizes his power.

A box will appear on the top of the screen when you have an active target including their name and health. When you have an active target, your melee attacks and spells will address to the active target, except these spells: Teleport, Wall of Fire, Wall of Stone, Starfall Storm, Hell Storm. These spells must be targeted by pointing your cursor to your target.Melee attackThis is a really unique feature we implemented. The feature itself is not really unique, because most of the MMORPGs have this feature, right? But, we made a little tweak, which makes the game more realistic, yet harder. You can use Melee attack by left clicking on your mouse, but if you are too far away from the target, you will miss! This being said, to use Melee attack you must be really close to your target so you can hit them. There is also a cooldown system, after every hit you make, a bar in the bottom of the screen will show with a countdown. After you make a Melee attack against your target, you will have to wait a few seconds, depending on the weapon, to make your next Melee attack.
