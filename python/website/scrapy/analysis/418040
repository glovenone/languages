desc_long							评测						“Ever since Monument Valley first came out, I’ve been hooked on the Escheresque art style, so I love seeing new games come out that carry this particular look and feel to it. And since puzzles are one of my favorite genres, it seems that Hocus is just a perfect fit for me, and anyone else who likes the genre.”80/100 – AppAdvice“But there’s still something to be said for a game so focused on one single, brilliant idea, and Hocus is a fine example of that.”80/100 – Touch Arcade“Hocus, a brain-twisting puzzler which shot to the top of the App Store charts this weekend, leverages that impulse in a game that would surely entertain Escher himself.”80/100 – Gamezebo												关于这款游戏							hocus. is a minimal perspective illusion puzzle based on M.C.
