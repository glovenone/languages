In this case, it’s a program that, for some people, might actually make virtual reality a enjoyable, even practical, replacement for their monitor.”Kotaku“It's an incredibly polished app that take minimal resources to provide a number of functions that feel like they should be a standardised part of the VR experience coming to consumer homes.”Destructoid“This is the first program you should buy for your Oculus Rift”Polygon													Update 1.0.5 is now live!									This release fixes SBS support on ultra-wide (21:9) monitors and Over-Under on regular (4:3) monitors. It also fixes an issue where the GPU usage could spike when the application was idle with the Rift.																							Update 1.0.4 is now live!									This update adds a couple requested features and basic support for various controllers. Added support for rotated monitors (aka portrait orientation) Added new Mip Mapping option for Rift users which greatly reduces text aliasing on screen Added basic mouse emulation with Vive touchpads Added basic mouse emulation with Xbox controller and Oculus Remote for Rift users Fixed crash with Over Under option in some environments Reduced CPU usage and fixed leak when application is idle with Rift																							Update 1.0.3 is now live!

With the launch, 3 very cool environments created by community members are available: Cinema Rick's Garage Cerebral TheaterPurchased environments will also be available from the Oculus Home version if you have a Rift but you will need to run Virtual Desktop on Steam first after you've made your purchase. Note: The store only works with Chrome at the moment. Added ability to delete photos directly from the 360 Photos tab Fixed issue with subscribed workshop environments not loading when VRD is installed in a non-default location Fixed certificate issue with some users when pasting YouTube 360 videos Fixed black screen in home theater when multi-monitor was enabled																							Update 1.0.1 is now live!

Virtual Desktop is now available to Play! The first time you launch it, you will be prompted with a key. This key lets you redeem the app on Oculus Home (if you have a Rift) through Settings -> Account -> Redeem Code.If you encounter any issues, please let me know in the discussions section.The Workshop integration is partially there: you can create and submit your own environments, users will be able to download them in a future update.Enjoy!																						关于这款软件							Virtual Desktop is an application developed for the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive that lets you use your computer in VR.
