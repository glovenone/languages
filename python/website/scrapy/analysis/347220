desc_long									Welcome Ambitious Space Prospector!									First off, thanks for checking out The Cosmos Is MINE! Set in an alternate 1950s universe, The Cosmos is MINE! is a multiplayer RTS where you control a galactic prospecting team in an interstellar resource war against other greedy space miners. With an engrossing two-method system to victory and amusing tongue-in-cheek setting of space-faring super-capitalism, get ready to make the cosmos yours!As the game is in a very early stage of development, the Australian dev team at Playcorp is launching the game on Early Access with the full intent on using Early Access as it should be - to gain valuable user feedback and use suggestions from players. If you have suggestions for the game or would like to see the current roadmap, you can do so at their UserVoice page. To see how they'll be using your feedback, read this developer blog post.It should be noted that the game is in an early stage of development with current features limited to focus on improving the fundamental gameplay experience:1)	Online play is a huge focus for the game and it is HIGHLY recommended that if you plan to play the game, to play online in multiplayer games with the Steam friends you recruit! :)2)	The single-player Solo Play mode should be used to get first time players acclimated to the basic game and camera controls. AI opponents are now available but they are aggressive and have no mercy.3)	After you finish playing an online game, if you should have problems connecting to players in a new online game, it’s recommended you restart the entire game.  4)	There’s a good chance you’ll run into a bugs with an Early Access game – should you encounter a bug in The Cosmos is MINE! please post a report in our Steam Community Forums.The development team wants to hear constructive criticism and great suggestions; for this purpose they have setup very effective feedback system through UserVoice.
