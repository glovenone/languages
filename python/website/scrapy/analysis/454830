desc_long								关于这款游戏							Have you ever had enough beach balls? Can you have enough beach balls?Beach Ball Valley is a timeless, hand crafted, free range, beach ball preserve. You and your giant pizza peel* hands are invited to spend some time in the sun, batting beach balls, pilling 'em up, and just watching them roam around the countryside.*(that's what a pizza paddle is officially called I guess)As an added bonus, there's a way you can gain telekinetic power over beach balls, and use whatever ball you posses to herd the rest of them around the valley. I'm not going to tell you how to do that. Good luck.Also, there's apparently a game mode where you've got one minute to hit them through hoops for points and stuff. That's included in case people don't understand how fun just hitting beach balls around it. It keeps score for about 100 or 200 of your rounds (but doesn't save it yet!) in case you want to run it at a party and track high scores. Oh, did I mention that if you can use telekinetic powers in it, you can wow your friends?There is also a host of buttons active on your keyboard for messing with whoever is in VR. Toggle gravity. Make 'em a giant! Pop all their beach balls! (No! Don't be a picklepuss!) Launch storms at 'em or drop huge beach balls on their heads instead.FAQ:Why pizza peels?I like pizza. Also, they're great for reach out really far and hitting things. They also hit stuff really hard!Is there a Beach?There is not a beach. These are inland meadow beach balls.Do the beach balls mind being hit?Every beach ball dreams of flight, and their thick rubbery carapaces are suited for rapid acceleration.How many beach balls can I have?Once there are 500 beach balls, scientists believe they could develop a sentient network as well as flight capabilities. They'll head off planet in search of dull worlds in need of fun. The static electricity given off by beach balls may cause a spike in microburst storm systems.Why are the clouds eating my beach balls?Fredricko the Cloud believes that due to the non-biodegradable nature of beach balls, it's his duty to clean up after anyone who's made too many beach balls. He's also hungry. He's the one by the small hill, not to be confused with Gerando or Luis.What's the Difference between seated / standing / roomscale?Beach balls come to you. Standing / Room Scale affords a little more space.How do I get more Beach Balls?Look at the paddles! They've got buttons everywhere! Push the buttons! Push all the buttons!Basic Gameplay:Hit Beach Balls!Triggers = Spawn more balls.Advanced Gameplay:Menu Buttons = Hoop Game or Big Beach Balls (Depending on the hand)Trackpads = Beach Balls from Clouds.Grips = Teleports??? = Mind Control a Beach BallSecret Elite Early Access Testing Commands: (Use 'em to amaze your friends!)B – Spawn a huge beach ball (Same on a controller, but useful for droppin' on friends)G – Toggle Giant Mode (currently requires two taps)Z – Toggle Zero Gravity (only applies to currently active beach balls)R – Add a Storm System (make your own thunder sounds)P – pop all the balls (but why?!)L – Toggle Game Scores (they start out visible)Beach Ball Valley uses the Unreal® Engine.
