If you are sensitive to disturbing thoughts/images, play at your own risk.Judgement is a story-driven, decision-making adventure game, where your Judgement can mean the difference between life, death, or somewhere in between. It's a game of morality and how gray it can be. In addition to a polished combat system, Judgement features a dynamic story where each decision leads to a different outcome in the game. In all, there are thousands of different combinations of choices the player can make, so each player (or playthrough) will have a different experience and a different ending.The game is trickled with collectible notes, which offer food for thought when it comes to decisions that the player will make, or already has made, in the game or in real life.Judgement, in its first form, was created when the designer was at the angsty age of 15. The perspectives and themes have their origins in a 15-year old boy trying to tell a story. It's been worked on here and there and has reached the point that it's at today.
