Currently in Early Access, it’s a very lovely thing indeed.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun“Given its polish, this title is leagues ahead of most Early Access games.”Start2Continue“Battle Brothers has the potential to be one of Early Access’s brightest success stories.”Attack of the Fanboy													What's in the Deluxe Edition?									Just as the normal edition, the Deluxe Edition includes the game in its current Early Access version and all future updates up to and including the full game release. Additionally, all buyers will receive the complete Battle Brothers soundtrack as a digital download once it is finished and released. The game already features more than one hour of music with signature tracks for all the factions and places. The difference in price to the basic edition will go directly to the talented musicians who are creating all the music for Battle Brothers.																							What's in the Supporter Edition?									For those of you who really want to support us in the future development of Battle Brothers we also offer the Supporter Edition. Like the Deluxe Edition, this includes both the game itself and the soundtrack. In addition, you’ll get a digital lore book with a lot of background info about the world and its inhabitants, as well as our very first legendary item in the game, complete with a look of its own and a unique background story: Fangshire.For all editions, please take note that both the soundtrack and the lore book are not yet done and will only be delivered once they’ve been finalized. You can expect them to be done at around the time the game leaves Early Access.																						关于这款游戏							Battle Brothers is a turn based strategy RPG mix which has you leading a mercenary company in a gritty, low-power, medieval fantasy world. You decide where to go, whom to hire or to fight, what contracts to take and how to train and equip your men in a procedurally generated open world campaign. Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory?The game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat. Procedurally generated worldmap, tactical combat maps and mercenaries. Open and dynamic world simulation that is not scripted - your actions can actually alter the balance of the world. All characters come with their own background stories and traits. Want a stuttering ratcatcher, a greedy witchhunter or a drunkard disowned noble? Permadeath. All characters that die in combat will stay dead - unless they return as the undead. Field up to 12 Battle Brothers on large and varied tactical combat maps with different terrain and multiple height levels. Character development without a restrictive class-system. Each Battle Brother gains experience through combat, can level up and acquire powerful perks. Equipment that matters. Different weapons grant unique skills – split shields with axes, stun enemies with maces, form a spearwall with spears or crush armor with a warhammer. Diverse enemy roster. All enemies have unique equipment, skills and AI behavior. A dynamic event system with atmospheric encounters and tough decisions outside of combat. One full hour of orchestral soundtrack with more on the way. More detailed combat environments that reflect where you are on the worldmap, including weather effects like rain and snow. Customizable formations for your men to deploy in. A larger roster and the ability to put men into reserve. A fully skinned UI. More content: More enemies, items, contracts, character backgrounds and events.Overhype Studios is an independent game developer studio from Hamburg, Germany. We are devoted to making great games that we want to play ourselves. With Battle Brothers we thrive to reflect the creativity, complexity and originality from the old days when game developers where passionate gamers, not corporate businessmen. While doing this we took a lot of inspiration from some of best games out there: The original X-Com, Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat, Mount & Blade and Jagged Alliance.
