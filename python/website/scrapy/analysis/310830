The differences between them mean that no two levels ever feel the same, and they are always throwing new ideas your way.”God is a Geek“RETROBOOSTER seems designed to screw up your life, but honestly, and to your face, without half-truths or tricks.”Nivel Oculto												关于这款游戏							A tough-as-nails cave-flyer for players who want a solid challenge. Stay on your toes or this galaxy will devour you.Retrobooster is an exceptionally difficult 2.5D shooter, focused on skill-based flying and enemy blasting. Pilot your nimble thrust ship through bizarre worlds littered with vicious enemies. Each new level takes you farther from home and, ultimately, into the deadliest reaches of the galaxy. Retrobooster also has speed-flying challenges, puzzles, juicy monsters, a warped sense of humor, and a healthy dose of bullet hell action. Survive to the end if you can, and use your new flying skills to replay for high scores.FeaturesMaster classic thrust ship controls, plus reverse thrustEnjoy detailed physics (with plenty of death by crushing)Navigate 30+ increasingly diabolical levelsUnlocked levels can be replayed any timeUnleash 10 fierce weapons on a galaxy of enemiesChallenge yourself with 4 difficulty levelsCustomizable controls, because Retrobooster is all about daring flying and unbridled shootingKeyboardMouse and keyboardGame controller (Some popular controllers are recognized automatically)Split-screen multiplayer for up to 4 players (no online multiplayer)Cooperative and deathmatch multiplayer modesElectronic soundtrack by Subatomicglue frontman, Kevin Meinert
