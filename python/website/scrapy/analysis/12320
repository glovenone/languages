SACRED - The new name in Action-RPGs. SACRED delivers a huge, elaborate world comprising 16 regions beset with heroic quests, battle-hardened warriors and horrific enemies.

SACRED Plus - Incorporates all of the feedback from the player community since the first release of SACRED. This includes  an optimized interface, and many completely new features: two new regions, two additional main quests, new item sets and weapons, and many new creature types which make adventuring in Ancaria even more dangerous.					SACRED  Underworld - Ancaria is facing a threat far greater than ever before. The now familiar world continues to evolve, with existing SACRED players able to import their old characters into the Underworld.

Hundreds of unique weapons, armors and set items - collect artifacts and forge all-powerful weapons!					Learn Combat Arts, develop new skills, and customize devastating combo-attacks.
