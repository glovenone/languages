desc_long							评测						“...the kind of blunt satire of which even South Park might think better.”Wired“Definitely one of the most British games I've ever played”Jim Sterling“Repeatedly smash David Cameron into a wall... the most satisfying game mechanic ever created”PCGamesN												关于这款游戏							This game is a parody.It is definitely, positively and (hopefully) legally, NOT the game Grand Theft Auto Five.Sure, it's called NotGTAV, but those letters stand for Great Traffic Adventure and the V is silent. Like the one in "lawsuit" (which, you'll notice, is also invisible).This short tour of the glories of the UK’s M4 corridor is easy to play, hard to master, addictive, very funny, and cheap.100% of the profits from this game go to young people’s charity Peer Productions. Without Peer Productions the NotGames team would never have met. By buying this game you can help us pay something back.NotGames: Sticking it to the virtual man since about ten minutes ago.FAQ:Q: Is it meant to look that bad?A: Yes.Q: Really?A: Yes.  Really.  It's satire.  Like South Park.Q: Is it meant to be just Snake?A: Again, yes.  That's kinda the point of the satire, see?Q: So why should I buy it exactly?A: We guarantee it'll be the funniest game of Snake you've ever played.  Especially if you know anything about the UK.  Or an infamous driving game. Or have, you know, a sense of humour.
