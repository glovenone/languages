You can even get Cortex Card packs (which can also be purchased for cashy money) by collecting Brownie Points, in case you don’t want to take a job from Captain Mal, but still want to collect those shiny Cortex Cards. Another benefit of being a Big Damn Hero is the Crappy Town Where You’re the Hero adventure. When Firefly Online is released, Big Damn Heroes will be invited to accept a job in a little frontier town where folks are in sore need of someone to step up and deliver them from oppression. After completing the job (details of that job will be yours to discover along the way), you’ll earn a statue with your captain’s likeness, placed smack dab in the middle of town square for all to see – including other players.Big Damn Hero exclusives include:•  The Map of the Verse.•  The “Crappy Town Where You’re a Hero” adventure to earn a statue of your captain.•  Ability to collect Cortex Cards and earn rare digital items for use in the game.•  Your name in the game credits.•  Badges to show off your account rank.•  Developer Diaries and interviews.•  Surveys soliciting your feedback on game features.•  A chance to submit ideas during our Big Damn Contests.•  Assuming enough folks like being BDHs, this list of shiny exclusives will continue to grow!Firefly Online is a self-funded game being created by an independent team of industry veterans who share your love of Firefly. We’re hoping there are Firefly fans out there in the Black who want to support our efforts, and you’ll be doing just that when you become a Big Damn Hero.
