(Difficult mode requires extreme patience.)- Simple dialogues that should make it easier for very young children to understand.- Fight goons using basic addition skills.- Learn new skills as you battle more difficult enemies.- Help villagers with their daily math problems and be rewarded with useful items.- Collect armor sets that bestow various advantages.OUR STORY:The game began as a capstone project from students at the De La Salle - College of Saint Benilde (B-Team). The team had noticed that many elementary school kids are afraid of math, and tried to figure out how we can ease up the situation in our own small way. Perhaps creating a math RPG could be a fun experiment, we thought. The game was tested by kids ages 10 and below, and just before graduating, the team decided to push for publication. We were joined by Asia Pacific College interns for the music and quality assurance.OUR TEAM:Lead Designer: Steven EscarlanLevel Designer: Blue VergaraProgrammer: Francisco BateExterior Tile Artist: Jeremy PlanaComposer: Nhyne JunioLead QA: Neil AlcuranProducer/Programmer/Designer: Arvin D.
