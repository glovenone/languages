desc_long									Warning									Pocket Rumble is currently in a very early state. There are only three characters available, and there is no real single-player content. There is ranked online multiplayer and there is a mostly-functional training mode. Some secondary features and superficial touches are missing and most of the game modes are currently inaccessible.We will be updating frequently, adding a character each month until the roster is complete, and adding other features along the way. If you purchase Pocket Rumble right now, know that you won't be getting your $10 worth right away. Consider it a preorder for the full game, which should be complete within a year. Early Access is just a bonus for you and a testing ground for us.																						关于这款游戏							Pocket Rumble is a streamlined, beginner-friendly 2D fighting game inspired by SNK's classic fighters for the Neo Geo Pocket Color.
