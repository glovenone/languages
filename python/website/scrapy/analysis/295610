A thoughtful critique smartly grounded in its simplicity ... the perfect way to cap off your soldier’s exploits.”Indie Statik“...as with the rest of the game, these snippets and bits of writing are ultimately a tool ... for creating an illusion, or a sense, of place – and at the very end of the game, a very specific mental space that the game ultimately, laudably, inhabits.”The Slowdown“...overall Inescapable is a polished and engaging experience that is a worthy tribute to the games that inspired its creation.”RGCD												关于这款游戏							The debut release from Magnetic Realms is a Sci-Fi action adventure called "Inescapable".Named the "Best PC Metroidvania You Didn’t Play of 2013" by Matthew Zulawski of metroidvanias.com and listed as a notable game in indiegames.com's Top 10 Indie Horror Games of 2013, the game sees players unravel the mystery uncovered by a remote interplanetary mining operation.
