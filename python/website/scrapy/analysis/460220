desc_long								关于这款游戏							Xenoraid is a vertically scrolling shoot’em up focusing on exciting action and deliberate shooting. Bullet hell aspects are balanced to be exciting but not overwhelming.Set in the year 2032, Xenoraid depicts the first ever space war. Earth is under attack by a small alien raiding fleet, and starfighters are improvised by arming existing spacecrafts with machineguns, autocannons, missiles and experimental weapons.Missions are driven procedurally from set parameters, keeping the action fresh. Enemies always appear from surprising directions and in various formations, removing mission memorization from gameplay.In Xenoraid up to four fighters take part in each mission and you can switch between them at will. All shot up and about to explode? Bring in a fresh fighter! A heavy enemy giving you trouble? Switch to the fighter with a 100mm cannon to blast it to bits!The best way to destroy attacking alien fighters is to fire short and controlled bursts. Constantly blasting away will overheat guns and lock them down for emergency cooling. Lining up a shot and squeezing the trigger is way more satisfying than nonstop spraying and praying.In Xenoraid player fighters turn lightly when moving left and right, allowing shooting in angles. Shooting in angles emphasizes aiming even more as an exciting core mechanic.Xenoraid features a campaign mode with several multi-mission battles, bosses, weapon and tech upgrades, and storyline.The campaign mode and Survival game mode are playable as local co-op with full gamepad support.
