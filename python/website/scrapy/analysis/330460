desc_long								关于这款游戏							Celestial Command is a realistic sandbox space game which unites real space flight, real orbital mechanics, and all the fun of classic space action games.We want to show how games about space actually should look, without silly vacuum friction and the maximum speed limit. As in the real world, everything in this game is in continuous motion in orbit.Realistic Orbital MechanicThis game is not about silly vacuum friction and maximum speed limitation. It is about real physics and orbital mechanics like in the real world! Get to know with orbital maneuvering, launching satellites and protecting planets from asteroids.Fully customizable ShipsYou can build your own ship part by part. Each part of the ship is individual, it has own functions and parameters. Therefore, abilities of your ship are completely dependent on the modules from which it is assembled. You can build small explorers, large industrial ships, carriers, defence satellites or whatever you want.Ship ManagementAll resources of the ship are limited. Including fuel, energy, ammo and parts for repair, so store them and use them wisely.Command a FleetYou are not bound to the single ship. You can build as many ships and space stations as you want. And you can switch between them anytime.Seamless Star SystemExplore a procedural world filled with planets, asteroids, space stations and other fun stuff. The world of the game is completely seamless, you can zoom out from your ship to the whole star system.Gather ResourcesSurvey asteroids for useful resources, extract it from planets or salvage wreckage of defeated enemies.Multistage Production SystemThe extraction of raw materials is not enough to build a new ship. You need to process raw materials in special facilities to produce parts that are required to construct ship's modules.Fight the EnemyBuild various types of devices to fight against enemies. Cannons, lasers, rockets, shields and other useful devices.There you can explore the procedural world, find the resources, build any type of ships or space stations which you want, command your fleet and fight with enemies.The game is 2D, so it is pretty easy and fun to play, but we implemented unique graphic style, which allows it to look like 3D with modern lighting and effects.Also, the game has now been in active development, so if you are interested, check out our development blog for new features and future plans.
