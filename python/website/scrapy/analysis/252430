All in all, a wonderful way to take out the stresses of a normal working day by exploding, shooting and beating the bejeebles out of anything that had the audacity to appear on-screen.”8/10 – Calm Down Tom“Dusty Revenge is a fast paced 2D action platformer that stays true to its fighting genre and strengthens the shoot and beat ‘em up style of gameplay.”9.5/10 – Capsule Computers“I had fun with Dusty Revenge and think fans of side scrolling beat ‘em ups or modern action games like Devil May Cry will as well.”85% – Game Vortex												关于这款游戏							Revenge will consume you, but redemption will push you to your breaking point.Play as Dusty, a multi- weapon wielding warrior ready to face loads of outlawed criminals, dangerous creatures and the ruthless evil villain that rules them all.

It does a lot of work to keep the game interesting and varied for its players, something very few brawlers manage to pull off effectively.”
