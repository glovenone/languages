It combines expressive 2D sprites and nostalgic platforming with some grade-A, modern action-RPG mechanics and does it generally well.”8,5/10 – Arcade Sushi“What we have here is a standout in multiple ways. Almost best in class, really.”8/10 – Chalgyr's Game Room“Dreadlocks has left no stone unturned in its quest to craft an authentic cyberpunk world.”Strategy Informer												关于这款游戏							Discover the truth behind an enigmatic AI striving to reach the Singularity, a theoretical “event horizon” in which artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence and all bets about the future will be off. How will you play your part in the story?Explore the futuristic city of Harbor Prime and meet its many inhabitants, answer the challenges the city has to offer, roam the neon-lit streets, and augment your character with skills and implants. Designed as a tribute to the classic RPGs from the ‘90s, updated for a modern audience, Dex invites you to become part of a living, breathing cyberpunk universe as you decide which ultimate path you will embrace.
