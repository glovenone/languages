Similar to other forms of art that tackle these issues, Actual Sunlight can be an extremely powerful emotional experience – before downloading it, please first consider what your reaction to a book, film or piece of music in a similar vein might be.For immediate updates on the game, please follow Will O'Neill on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/willoneill
