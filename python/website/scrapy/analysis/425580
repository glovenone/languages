That’s something games too often are not. The Room Two unquestionably is – a properly interesting experience”Rock, Paper, Shotgun“With its powerful atmosphere and involved environmental puzzles you want to curl up in a dark room with this title and experience all it has to offer”8.25 – Game Informer“The Room Two improves on almost every aspect of the original, with better graphics, more puzzles to solve, and more of the same thrilling storytelling”9.4 – Cnet												关于这款游戏							Following the release of The Room in 2014, Fireproof Games are proud to bring the critically acclaimed sequel to PC.The Room Two continues the time-spanning journey of its predecessor while significantly expanding its unique puzzle gameplay. Follow a trail of cryptic letters from an enigmatic scientist known only as “AS” into a compelling world of challenging mystery and tactile exploration.Development on this fully-enhanced HD version of The Room Two began shortly after the mobile release of The Room Three late in 2015 and has involved creating more detailed environments for each level as well as rebuilding and re-texturing every asset in the game.Fireproof Games are a small independent team working in Guildford in the UK. We self-published our first game The Room on iPad in September 2012 and were stunned with both the critical success and our new-found fan-base, not to mention multiple international awards. The Room games have since changed our lives and we hope you enjoy playing them as much as we enjoyed making them.
