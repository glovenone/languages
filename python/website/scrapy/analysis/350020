It actually lacks some of Bahamut’s central features, including factions and clan support, but whatever arcane mélange of art, audio, accessibility, difficulty, and pacing it is that lets a game bury its hooks deep into a player, The Gate has it. If you’re a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to try this game – and if you’re not, it’s a pretty good place to start.”4.5/5 – Gamezebo“American McGee and Spicy Horse Games have just launched The Gate on iOS and the wait was worth it. They have created an app that stands tall above other card collecting and tournament fighting games by using real time strategy elements and crafting an experience that’s fun and extremely addictive. The look of The Gate is amazing and uses 3D elements to highlight layers that make each level organic and fluid.”4.5/5 – http://www.chud.com/147103/ios-app-review-the-gate/												关于这款游戏							Another soul passes through The Gate only to discover an underworld of demonic armies and infernal battles.
