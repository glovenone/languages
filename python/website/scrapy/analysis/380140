Art style is just amazing, I love it, it kinda looks like you gave an artist just a simple grayish marker and he did a miracle with it. Game features a few puzzles that can be easily solved, well most of them, some will actually require some thinking, but it's nothing too complicated - trust me.”8.5/10 – Epic Reviews“this game deserves 10 potatoes out of 10”10 potatoes out of 10 – Philyrood“graficos potato, animación potato, secuestro potato, puzzles potato. 20/10 GOTY”20/10 – Zilch												关于这款游戏							A game about games, secrets and stuff.In the near future, thanks to copyright and patent law abuse, all of the gaming industry became controlled by one corporation, producing low quality but highly profitable casual freemium games and ceasing development of any other more ambitious genres. Any game development outside of the company became outlawed, ending the era of indie games. Assist young Max Burton, a mighty gamedev wannabe and enthusiastic fresh intern on his first day at his first job in the only gamedev company out there in this short, (soon to be) award-winning free point-and-click adventure game. Explore the deepest SECRETs™ of the Tremendous Corporation®. Find out what happened to indie devs and save the gaming industry! Now on GNU/Linux and Windows, Mac OS X coming soon.The first version of this game has been made during Global Game Jam 2015 under the name "The Game Jam Game About Games, Secrets and Stuff".
