Construct decks and build strategies to fulfil the objectives of your chosen quests and reap the hard-won rewards!Of course, for every quest a player completes, they must then make a choice between Good & Evil...Morality Core to all Fable games is the player's choice to use their heroic powers for Good or Evil - and Fortune continues that legacy.  Over the course of each battle, the player's hero will morph to reflect their alignment, changing the effects of their special abilities and also morphing many cards in their deck into more powerful variants.Wise choices as to when to follow the path of Skorm or Avo, can turn even the closest of matches.Co-OpMake friends you'll keep for a lifetime!Fable Fortune will feature a co-op mode entirely unique to the CCG genre, allowing you to team-up with a friend against a host of Fable villains such as Nostro or Logan.While each player builds their own deck, their units are shared in a fast-paced brawl that creates many epic dual deck combinations! Events There’s something for everyone in Fortune because it has been designed with a strong event system at its core.At any one time there will be the core PvP league, a co-op boss and at least one gameplay warping event available to play. Whether you are ultra-competitive or prefer co-operative games, brand new to card games or a 20-year veteran, you’ll always find something to excite you within Fable Fortune.
