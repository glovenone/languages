It can’t be missing in any indie game collection.”Bit Maiden“Without a shadow of doubt, 99 Spirits is one of the most imaginative and accomplished indie games on the market.”True PC Gaming“Mixing the puzzle and RPG genre along with some anime themed influences, 99 Spirits became an absorbing and addicting title that was nearly impossible for me to put down for too long.”Moonlitasteria												关于这款游戏							99 Spirits is an RPG/Puzzle game that revolves around the popular Japanese folklore of Tsukumogami, everyday objects coming alive on their 100th birthday.Hanabusa is a young headstrong girl living in the Heian capital within medieval Japan.
