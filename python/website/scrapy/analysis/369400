desc_long							评测						“Now, the developers have decided to go indirect and to pull the lever attached to the gate, you’ll have to solve the mystery behind. It’s not a puzzle of numbers but you have to establish a link between the members placed in a physical world. So there you have pulleys, flat boards, wheels, etc which are all available in different numbers and you have to place them in a way so that a ball can pass through them and hit the lever. This game is different from others in the sense that there are far too many elements especially at the later stages of the game.”4.0 – Apps4REview“I really liked the graphics for their not-so-great finishing. They are delicate but designed with curiosity. There is a cartoon-like theme that goes very well with the gameplay.”4.5 – http://apps400.com/iphone-apps/let-the-cat-in-seriously-complex.html“It is an interesting and challenging game where you got to use your skills at each stage to solve problems with a variety of tools. Each stage is diverse and unique with a different solution. To find this solution, you must analyze the clues from the current and previous stages. Completion of the current stage will unlock the next one for you.”9.0/10 – http://webapprater.com/reviews/let-cat-free-time-rack-brains-save-cat.html													Steam 青睐之光																															关于这款游戏							Let The Cat In is the cute puzzle game about little kittens that you need to help get into the house.
