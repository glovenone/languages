desc_long							评测						“It’s a comforting reminder that video games can still hark back to their traditional roots and produce an enjoyable experience without any overblown live-action trailer or day one DLC. This is a delight to play.”9/10 – Game Watcher“I can’t recommend this series enough for anyone who wants to sit down and enjoy an old style point and click adventure game.”5/5 – Gaming Shogun“KING Art has outdone themselves with 'Book of Unwritten Tales 2' and firmly established their craft as premiere adventure developers. This is a long game for the genre, over 20 hours, with a reasonable price point. It is also laugh-out-loud funny in many places and has an acerbic wit as well as excellent pacing and puzzles, and manages to accomplish all of this without taking itself too seriously. It is one of the best adventure games in recent memory.”4.5/5 – High-Def Digest													Quotes									“A sequel that definitely builds upon the promise shown in its predecessor. A great combination of fantasy adventure and comedy.” - Robin Parker God is a Geek - 8/10“The Book Of Unwritten Tales 2 is one of the best point and click adventure titles to be released, and stands as an example of what the genre has to offer. I would easily place it in the company of revered adventure titles like Grim Fandango or Tales Of Monkey Island, perhaps even surpassing them as it takes what made those titles great and expands upon them.” – The Sixth Axis - 9/10																						关于这款游戏							Every world needs its heroes. However unlikely they may seem. Join Wilbur, Ivo, Nate and Critter in another classic point-and-click adventure in the wicked world of Aventásia. Help them fulfill their destiny. A destiny as yet unwritten.The TaleA few years have passed since our heroes heroically defeated the arch-witch Mortroga. And their lives, like the lives of most people in Aventásia, are still in turmoil. The War of the Two Towers is over, but the wounds it left upon the land are still bleeding.The gnome Wilbur Weathervane is struggling with his new job as a teacher at the reopened School for Wizardry and Witchcraft. His magic wand is having a mind of its own and an assassination plot against the arch-mage overshadows the first democratic elections in Seastone.Faced with political intrigues that threaten the delicate balance of peace, Wilbur is in dire need of his old friends. But the elf princess Ivo and the adventurer Nate have, after a brief romantic interlude, gone their separate ways.Ivo has returned to her gilded cage in the elf kingdom, overprotected by her controlling mother.Nate along with his trusty companion Critter has been taken prisoner on the flying island of his arch-enemy the Red Pirate.But fate does not rest. A darkness has fallen upon the land, or rather, a pinkness. A magic force is turning mighty beasts into fluffy plush puppies and towering castles into oversized dollhouses.
