desc_long							评测						“It’s a sidescrolling game that uses a gun as the main form of interaction with the world, but its origins are in point and click rather than point and shoot. The dialogue is snappy, witty and weird, and the world is a delightful creation.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun“One of the things I love about reviewing indie games is the ingenuity and creativity. [Hot Tin Roof] definitely brings quite a bit of this to the table, with a pseudo-3D look and some interesting mechanics.”Twinfinite“As noir as the game is, it does have a sense of humor. Grizzled detectives somehow just seem to work alongside hat-wearing cats and mice in ties.”IndieGames												关于这款游戏							You’re the Private Investigator on a string of grisly murders, scouring for clues in a 3D side-scrolling world.
