When it works, it’s oddly satisfying. When it doesn’t work, it’s generally amusing.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun												关于这款游戏							Bot Colony is based on a thriller novel involving a large Japanese robot manufacturer, Nakagawa Corp. It’s 2021, and a spy from KHT, Nakagawa's arch-competitor, has infiltrated the high-tech giant’s seemingly impregnable south Pacific sanctuary. The spy has re-programmed the island’s robots and is destabilizing Bot Colony, but this is only the precursor to a larger, more terrifying scheme.You have 3 days to catch him, and you'll need to rely on machines to get the job done.In Bot Colony you have the opportunity to experience first-hand interaction with an Artificial Intelligence that, until now, could only be romanticized in science fiction novels and movies. It's a unique experience that will challenge your mind and entertain you; the ultra literal way robots understand language makes you realize how much we take for granted when we speak with other people.KEY FEATURESEmbark on a multi-episode quest to catch the spy before he destroys the island.Travel across a spectacular South Pacific island fully-realized in the Havok Vision engine.Speak freely and discover the story using your own words. Compare this to typical game storytelling, where canned dialog lines and selection trees are the rule. Make the game your own: Teach robots about people and the world to get them to help you.Command robots to manipulate objects and interact with the environment.Game sessions are unique to each player: You control what is said and how characters react. Sessions of other players will have different dialog than yours.Based on the Bot Colony novel by studio founder and high-tech entrepreneur Eugene Joseph.Note regarding Speech-to-Text: The game comes to Steam with support for Microsoft Speech (included with Windows), so you can set up a voice profile to play the game and communicate with characters by speaking into a mic. Remember that we also allow players to type messages, or you can seamlessly combine speaking and typing according to one’s preference. We do not offer a Dragon version of the game on Steam, but we're pleased to offer full speech-to-text support for players who already own Dragon NaturallySpeaking[/b].[/list]
