Adam Apple, also known as Fantabulous, creates energy shields with ease, has punched thugs into submission, soars through the air with ease and attempts to seduce everyone he meets. The little tinker would seduce a death ray into submission if he thought it would respond to his dubious charms.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun“it delivers a lengthy and surprisingly action-packed tale with memorable characters, dramatic moments, and some very cool scenes to play your part in.”JayIsGames“Heroes Rise does a great job with the design and writing of its decision points. Some are pure action and strategy, but most are focused on who you are as a hero (or, potentially, a villain) and how you will relate to those around you.”4/5 – TouchArcade												关于这款游戏							Do you have what it takes to become a legendary Powered hero?In "Heroes Rise," Powered heroes have become the ultimate celebrities, and you dream of joining the A-List–but to get there, you'll first have to take down evil Powered gangs, compete with deadly rivals, choose a worthy sidekick, team up with famous champions, and prove to all of Millennia City that you're a true hero.
