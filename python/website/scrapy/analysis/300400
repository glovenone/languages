desc_long							评测						“Unpossible is a decidedly slick twitchy dodge-'em-up that balances challenge, reward, and chaos.”8/10 – Pocket Gamer“Fantastic minimalist arcade survival game”4.5/5 – 148Apps												关于这款游戏							Unpossible will test your skills, your reflexes, and even your memory.  It will make you smile.  It will probably make you scream.  You will die often and it will always be your fault.  Fight to learn the obstacles…they already know how to fight you.  Relentless.  Thrilling.  Unpossible!Gameplay levels:Simplicity:  Super approachable introduction to the Unpossible world.  Hone your skills here.  Last 60 seconds in Simplicity to unlock Futile and Daily Futile.Futile:  Where most people will spend their time.  Faster than Simplicity, Futile will find your weaknesses and make you conquer them.  Survive for 60 seconds in Futile to unlock Ultra and Daily Ultra.Ultra:  It's Ultra Unpossible.  This is the pinnacle of Unpossible.  The obstacles spin, the sequences you learned before will need to be unlearned.  You will be challenged all the way to your soul.  Ultra is hardcore.  Masocore even.  Only the strongest will make it through Ultra.Daily gameplay levels:Daily Simplicity, Daily Futile and Daily Ultra.  If you like to practice the same level, these levels are for you.  These levels are the same difficulty as their namesakes except the levels stay the same for a full day.  There are also special achievements for the daily levels - beat them every day to find out!Special mode:Cruise:  This is the zen level.  You can’t die.  Practice your turns if you’d like or just watch it like a live-action art piece.  It’s chill.
