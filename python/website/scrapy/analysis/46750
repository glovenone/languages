The old hallways and train platforms echo with the ghosts of many eras, all trapped within the very fabric of the place, each hoping for salvation. The dusty old rooms seem possessed, exhibiting 'time slips' as the past becomes the present. You must tread very carefully, or you too many join the Lost Souls forever. So, why are you here?
