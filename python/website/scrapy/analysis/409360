It's worth the time to explore and put some time in, it's really fun.”Game Mode“Watching gameplay videos of action rogue-like Faron's Fate, from developer Winter Drake does not do justice to just how addictively fun this game is once you have your hands on it. Don't underestimate how long you might end up playing it for each time! While it can be enjoyed either for a few minutes or a few hours, I found myself itching to keep trying to get to the end "1 more time" ...”Bobmanbob												关于这款游戏							Adventure Dungeon 2: Faron's Fate is an action- roguelike about a lone adventurer venturing into a dungeon full of dangerous monsters and rare artifacts.
