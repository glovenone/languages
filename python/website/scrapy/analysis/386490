desc_long							评测						“Clever puzzle game rich in storytelling. Interesting game world with beautifully done music. Downside is that it’s a very short game. A must buy though for the emotionally driven experience.”9.5/10 – Video Game Break“While the linear experience harms replayability, Wanda is overall one of the most beautiful, poetic, compelling, and masterful examples of the narrative potential of video games.”8/10 – TechRaptor“Wanda: A Beautiful Apocalypse is a charming game that players who love story-rich RPGs will enjoy to no end. With pretty graphics, a great soundtrack and fun puzzles, the only complaint is that there needs to be more gameplay and story to lengthen this fairly short game. Regardless of that, we would definitely recommend playing this title- just make sure you have some tissues ready!”9.4/10 – 3rd-Strike												关于这款游戏							Wanda is a short and simple story about two lonely robots in a desolate, ruined world. Unlike many other ‘end-of-the-world’ games, Wanda is not about a tale of desperate survival but about finding companionship, love and hope in a wasteland.Wanda is a story-focused game but completely free of comprehensible dialogue. The entire story is told through the subtle interactions between the two robots and the environment itself in a “show, don't tell" style.Join this little adventure, solve mini-puzzles and witness the story unfold. Experience a whole new perspective of a post apocalyptic world through art-style reminiscent of a children’s book and delightful soundtracks.
