desc_long								关于这款游戏							Surgeon Simulator VR: Meet the Medic – be the Medic and operate on the Heavy in this free exclusive for HTC Vive!You’re leaning over a strangely familiar patient in dire need of a brand new heart, alongside an operating table full of terrifying implements you’d hoped never to have to pick up for yourself. What will you do? Which one will you reach for first? The bonesaw, or a sandvich…?Now, you have the chance to get truly ‘hands-on’ and test your backstreet surgery skills in VR.  Surgeon Simulator VR: Meet the Medic, allows you to step into the shoes of Team Fortress 2’s, The Medic, where only you can save The Heavy as his life ebbs away before your very eyes. This brand-new virtual reality experience from Bossa Studios reunites two of TF2’s most-loved characters, who were originally brought to Surgeon Simulator back in 2013. Now, fresh into the VR stage, where you perform life-changing surgery under the gentle gaze of Archimedes, the dove from Valve’s hit game. Poke with a pencil, slash with a machete, chop with an axe, perform delicate tasks with a baseball bat; but be careful...time is ticking.
