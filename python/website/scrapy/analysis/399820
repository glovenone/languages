desc_long									Online multi-player in development									Online multi-player is in development for some time. We've made big progress and at the end of June or beginning of July 2016 it should be playable for testing. Local multi-player is playable now and supports up to 5 players (keyboard + 4 controllers).																						关于这款游戏							Skill-based gameplayIt may not look serious, but we guarantee, that it is. Kopanito's match engine is well-balanced. Use slide tackle to intercept passes or knock-down opponents (or even score a goal!). Pass the ball straight to your teammates (ground or air) or pass the ball between opponents. Score goals using chip shots or by swerving the ball using slow-motion shots. There are various set pieces, like corner kicks or throw-ins too, but no rules apart from that! Don’t forget, it is a fast-paced game - it might be funny and cartoonish, but it’s not that easy. Try it yourself!Try it with your friendsThere is support for up to 5 controllers (4 gamepads + keyboard). Try the game with your buddies in a friendly match in various game modes – in any desired combination including 5 vs AI game or play in cooperation through a tournament.Crush your opponent with a super-moveIf you play well-enough, you will be awarded with a super-move. Then you can pull the ball using a super-strong magnet (because why not) or teleport into a different spot on the field, activate a big windmaker to blow things out of your goal-line, perform a super-shot that knockout opponents down on the path of the ball and freeze your opponents with the freeze super-move. Oh, more crazy super-moves are coming!AI won’t let you restFour different difficulty levels. The easiest one is a child's play, while the last one... you'll pull your hair out trying to beat the game. Also, there’s a practice mode if you just want to learn basic moves.Many competitions to complete and teams to unlockWe focus on diversity. Complete 16 tournaments and leagues in different parts of the world with regional national teams. A tournament consist of a group stage and knockout stage. In a league we apply a round-robin system.
