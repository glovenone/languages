desc_long							评测						“The best Castlevania game in years.”9/10 – Destructoid“Just when I thought the game was winding down, it had only just begun to show itself to me, and with some solid challenge, pretty locations, and gruesome foes, I was happy to keep going.”IndieGames“Instead of just trying to mimic the appeal of games we miss, Odallus sits on the back of the giants it draws inspiration from and rethinks old ideas from a new angle.”9/10 – IGN												关于这款游戏							The old gods have forgotten this land.
