His name may derive from Latin “Murex”, a pointy-shelled sea snail, well-fitting a defensive combat strategy. He is heavily armored, fights with a gladius short sword and wields a large shield.The Hoplomachus derives his name from the Greek “Hoplon”, the typical round shield of Hellenic fighters. Clearly the inspiration for this gladiator class was the Hoplite with his “Sarissa” lance, fighting in the armies of Alexander. The Hoplomachus is a medium armored combatant focusing on spear and small shield.The Thraex class developed from the fierce warriors of the north-eastern province of Thrace. Gladiators of this type prefer fighting with curved swords such as the one-handed “Sica”. They wear medium armor and wield small rectangular shields.The most iconic of all gladiator classes, he fights with the “Rete”, the fishermen’s net, and the trident. Retiarii are only lightly armored, predominantly with solid shoulder armor, the “Galerus”. They do not use any shields, generally relying on their tridents wielded with both hands.
