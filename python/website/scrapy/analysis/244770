desc_long									Try out the full game for free in Alpha!									We are currently offering the full version of the game for free on our demo. This will be throughout Alpha as we believe a user wanting to purchase an open alpha game, should get to try out and test the current full state of the game first. We also need as many testers as possible, your reports, feedback and input is invaluable! So... why should you purchase the game if it's currently free? Support the developers! Purchased users will still have access to the latest updates when the demo stops being supported/updated in beta. Get it cheaper! As more features are added, the price will progressively increase. This will benefit those who supported the game earlier. We're adding upgraded only features to our Registry system, this will not directly affect any game features, however, it will give more access online. For example, blueprint hosting and multiple skin uploads for selection.What are you waiting for?
