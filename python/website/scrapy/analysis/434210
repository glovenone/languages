Engaging, educational, and easy to use.”4.3/5 – BestAppsForKids“For a game that's short and sweet, the aesthetics have to be spot on, and they are - the art design and direction is beautifully done, the narration good and the musical integration is superb.  There's evidently a huge amount of thought and effort gone into this, and if you have young children in the target range, it will be well worth the nominal fee.   IT's a "game" designed for a very specific group, and it does its job extremely well.”Indie Game News“Supposedly it’s an educational game “for children ages two and up” but I don’t think children would fully appreciate how wonderful it is when e.g. a rainbow saunters past on tippy-toes. No, this lesson in what the seasons are and what they do to the Earth and to trees and flowers and animals and floweranimals is clearly aimed at non-parents in their thirties looking to brush up on their natural sciences.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun												关于这款游戏							"It's Spring Again" - an educational game for children ages two and up.
