Luckily, he was quickly adopted by a rich couple and lived a life full of luxuries and peace. However, for 11 years, the only thing in David's mind was his defunct mother and their lonely past together. One morning, during his monthly visit to the graveyard where his mom rests, David meets an unknown woman who tells him what he was waiting to hear for many years: "David Garcia, do you want to meet your grandmother? Do you want to meet Remedios Garcia?" Fueled by the desire to know more about his family's past, David trusts the woman's words and travels to the town where his grandmother resides, Agapan.
