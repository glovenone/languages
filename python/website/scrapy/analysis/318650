SunAge´s singleplayer is challenging, in a way I haven´t been challenged by an RTS since I first played StarCraft.”90% – Honest Gamers“SunAge ends up being a very good RTS and takes the genre back to where it belongs.”85% – Gaming Console Network“SunAge is an enjoyable RTS with a visual style similar to the 2D offerings of the 90's. It has a great formations system and gives the player a feeling of issuing orders to their units, not micromanaging them.”80% – Gaming Shogun													The Story of SunAge									With Earth teetering on the brink of extinction, the human Federals and mutant-gene Raak-Zun are battling for control of its dwindling resources.
