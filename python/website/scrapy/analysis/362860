Games don’t do this kind of hermetic horror often, and Sylvio makes zero concessions.”80/100 – KillScreen“It’s a quiet horror game – an anti-screamer, right down to the calm almost-whispers of the protagonist – and it’s a triumph.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun“It's exciting, charmingly indie and above all, just the right amount of scary.”8/10 – IGN												关于这款游戏							Sylvio is a psychological horror game set in a tranquil, disturbing atmosphere.
