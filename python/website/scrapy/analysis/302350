This game engine allowed you to search virtual versions of each scene, for the clues you needed. While the ending is a little silly, the game was still a fantastic blend of real-time 3D exploration, and "interactive movie." A fond game memory.”100 – Techtite“With the release of Under a Killing Moon, Access Software has upped the ante in the genre of adventure gaming. Making a return appearance from Martian Memorandum as a hardboiled private investigator, Tex is ready to fumble his way again to solve a conspiracy involving a secretive organization with an agenda to destroy the world.”100 – Adventure Classic Gaming“Truly interactive video with great characters, script, and puzzles. Low frame rates for slower computers and all-but-forgotten art of disk swapping. It's a game that challenges and entertains; it leaves you wanting more of this believable virtual world.”92 – PC Gamer												关于这款游戏							Enter the virtual world of Under A Killing Moon, where it is December 2042, and you, as Tex Murphy, must stop the forces of evil before they destroy mankind and rob you of your next unemployment check.
