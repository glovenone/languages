This reviewer's initial impression was somewhat muted, in that he did not know if the product had "legs," but it stands up far better than most computer simulations.”100 – Computer Gaming World“Pirates! is a great game in every regard. Ship, land, and sword battles are all exciting. Reading maps and locating treasures adds another dimension to the game. You can even take over a town and give it to any country you choose.”100 – All Game Guide“If Pirates! II is one tenth as good as the original, I'll be glued to it for months. I'd give Pirates! an eleven out of ten, but they won't let me, so it gets a ten out of ten. If you get a chance to play it, don't pass it up.”100 – GamesAreFun.com												关于这款游戏							Ahoy Mateys! From the Mind of Sid Meier, The Golden Age of Buccaneering has returned with Pirates!
