Beat gravity into submission in LawBreakers, an exhilarating new first-person shooter where even the laws of physics can be shattered, creating unprecedented gravity-based combat across a bloody rebuilt American landscape. Team up, kill your enemies, control the objective, and enjoy the intense vertical chaos as you fight to preserve the law or break it.    A Cast Of Killers: Revel in unparalleled vertical violence by mastering the skills of an array of diverse anti-heroes, ranging from Cronos, a murderer who survived electrocution on death row, to Axel, a federal agent with a tattered past fighting for justice. Whether you kill for the nobility of the “Law” or are out for blood as a “Breaker”, these symmetrical roles satisfy any appetite in a game where the most skilled player and team will rise.Threats From Every Angle: Experience visceral gameplay that is a cut above the competitive FPS genre; with variable gravity effects, unique role-based movement systems and gravity-manipulating abilities, making combat truly three-dimensional. Become a gravity-surfing killer and annihilate your enemies with grappling blades, reverse blind firing, time dilation, jetpacks and much more.Modes that Matter: Fight to the death in intense game modes that elevate the shooter genre to all new levels. LawBreakers’ signature brand of gravity-induced chaos combined with innovative takes on multiplayer game modes offers a truly unique and highly competitive experience.A World Reimagined: Experience a futuristic America, years after a global seismic event known as “the Shattering” forever changed the landscape and even gravity itself. Become immersed in a ranging conflict between Law and Breakers across American iconic locations including the boiling oceans of Santa Monica, a gravity ravaged Grand Canyon and beyond.
