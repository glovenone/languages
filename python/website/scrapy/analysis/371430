By taking the design concepts from action titles and applying them to the dungeon crawling gameplay formula, OrangePixel have found a combination that synchronizes into some really enjoyable gameplay experience.”http://indiegames.com/2015/09/space_grunts_-_turn_based_acti.html“Underlying all the carnage is a game about limited resources. You're not just shuffling between guns to get the spatial drop on your foes, you're conserving different types of ammo for different situations”http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-01-08-space-grunts-is-a-turn-based-spin-on-nuclear-throne“It’s an attractive game, with just the right amount of screen-shudder and lovely pixel-gobbets of flesh and metal bouncing around the play area when a rocket hits the mark.”Rock Paper Shotgun												关于这款游戏							The year 2476, Earth's space-federation has been building moon-bases across the galaxy.
