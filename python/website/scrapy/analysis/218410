Improved graphics, more story, better performance, more of everything you love!																						关于这款游戏							Defender's Quest is a Tower-Defense/RPG Hybrid (Think Final Fantasy Tactics meets Tower Defense). It focuses on three things: tactical depth, customization, and story.  That means no random encounters, no spikey-haired emo kids, no forced time sinks, and no tedious, repetitive battles.The battle system builds off of tower defense, with individual characters taking the place of towers.  Each character levels-up, learns skills, and equips gear individually, allowing the player to customize their battle experience and strategy.  The overall game structure is similar to "tactical" RPG's, but with a real-time battle system.  Game speed is adjustable, and commands can even be issued while the game is paused.It also features an engaging, character-driven story written by an actual English major! The story strives to be fast-paced, snappy, and always relevant to gameplay with minimal exposition. Finally, it's got options and accessibility settings out the wazoo, so that you can have the best possible experience!--------NOTE: this game is currently locked at 30 FPS. This is mitigated by three factors: You have full control of time, so it doesn't affect reactions. The sprite sheets wouldn't animate any faster at 60 FPS anyway A full HD/60 FPS upgrade is coming soon as a free upgrade.---------End User License Agreement
