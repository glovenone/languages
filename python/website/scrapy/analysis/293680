desc_long							评测						“MoaCube focuses on the women of the tale and what made them who they are. The game is about nuance, is about understanding the motivations of another human being.”Kotaku“Asides from being delightfully well-written, highly replayable and filled with complex, convoluted characters, Cinders is also beautiful.”IndieGames“A visual novel that presents the deepest, most complex, most original, and ultimately most compelling re-imagination of the Cinderella universe.”91/100 – RPGFan												关于这款游戏							Cinders is a mature take on a classic fairytale with a heavy emphasis on player choices and role playing.Cinders is a witty young woman living with an overbearing stepmother and her two daughters, as if she was reenacting a certain well-known fairytale. But unlike its protagonist, Cinders is not afraid of taking fate into her own hands. Even if it means breaking the rules… The game takes a look at four women and what made them who they are. It’s a story about balancing freedom and dreams with circumstance and harsh reality. About growing up and finding out the true meaning of independence. Distancing itself from the judgmental simplicity of the original, Cinders tries to explore the more complex nature of oppression, responsibility and innocence. With 120 decision points, over 300 options to choose from, and multiple endings, Cinders gives you total control over the main character’s personality and how her story unfolds.LinksOfficial websiteTwitterFacebookTumblr
