As one of four technomages hiding in the shadows of New York City, your time has come to confront the Crucible of Fates, a mysterious testing ground that will magically pit you against your own psychological demons. Your journey through the Crucible has you fighting hordes upon hordes of enemies and overcoming deviously laid traps. Your tools are your lightning-fast shadow walk, the powerful glyphs you find, and the magical skills that you upgrade along the way. Your reward for survival? Unspeakable power and a chance to uncover your true fate.Key Features:Experience an extremely fast and satisfying action game, built around the ability to Shadow Walk Upgrade over a hundred magical skills, through an innovative system of randomly-generated skill trees Discover the profound and intense stories of four characters, told through beautifully illustrated cinematicsExplore a modern-day cyberpunk fantasy spanning cybernetics labs, dark alleys and secret societiesThe challenge - Combat in Leap of Fate is extremely quick and deadly. Not only will you face more than a hundred different types of enemies, ranging from pit fighters to mad cultists and hidden turrets, but the procedurally generated levels will keep you on your toes at all times.

Hopefully, you'll have unlocked new permanent upgrades to help you along.The magic - Within each game session, you will find many opportunities to gain magical power. In addition to the game-altering glyphs you randomly find along the way, there are more than a hundred magical abilities total, spread across the Mobility, Attack and Passive skill trees.
