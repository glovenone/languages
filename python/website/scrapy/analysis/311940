In most other shooters in this genre, you only have to look out for yourself. Well that's too easy we say. In P-3 Biotic, if the Nucleus dies, then it's game over. You'll find yourself switching from frantic defence to all out attack as you fight a desperate battle to keep the Nucleus alive. It doesn't help that you can use the energy stored in the Nucleus to over-power your weapons, turn your ship into a projectile, or release a devastating AOE shockwave, tempting you to walk a fine line between success and failure. Collect energy dropped by dead bacteria to keep the Nucleus powered up, but never forget it's defenceless while you're away.
