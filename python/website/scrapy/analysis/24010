Here’s a complete list of what’s included:Riviera Line In the FiftiesFeel the pressure of steam as you travel back to the time of Green and Gold, from the powerful Kings to the romantic Castles, the heavy working Halls, the goods-carrying Granges and the famous Pannier Tanks across the Riviera Line set in the nostalgic 1950s. Relive the time when steam reigned on all services from local freight to coastline express, whether you perform perfectly alone or need some assistance to get to your destination. Keep an eye on those signals, they can be easy to lose in the cold western fog.Sherman HillExperience the power of the fuel-hungry Big Blows across the challenging Sherman Hill as you haul hundreds upon hundreds of tons, putting that 8500 horsepower turbine through its paces, or opt for some conventional traction in the form of ES44ACs, drive in more comfortable conditions in the wide cab of the SD70M, or maybe in the classic SD40-2s. Watch out though, winter can be brutal even for the most powerful of locos.West Rhine Railway: Cologne – KoblenzControl the Genesis of modern Electro-motive traction as you haul heavy freight across the stunning West Rhine Railway in the DB BR 155 ‘Electric Container’, take passengers on their scenic commute with the DB BR 146 or shunt together a train to be taken far away with the DB BR 294. Be mindful of the weather, heavy rain can take even the best drivers by surprise.Railfan ModeEnjoy the power and finesse of the railway away from the drivers cab with railfan mode, watch from the platform, track side or stand on a bridge and take in the excitement without worrying about the journey, just make sure you’re ready to take some shots, you never know what you might see out on the tracks!Steam Edition: Norfolk Southern Coal DistrictStruggle through the beautifully scenic Mon Line as you haul mile long coal trains through the winding curves and streets of Pennsylvania. Collect coal as you drive your ES44AC slowly under the loading facilities and prepare for the run to the other end of the line. While being relatively level, the sharp river-side turns and the slow speeds as you cut right through a town will not be mastered easily.TS AcademyNew to driving trains? Not to worry! With the newly updated TS Academy you can learn all that you need to beat the extreme, from basic passenger operations to freight terminals that require pin-point accuracy or nailing those complex and unique signalling systems. TS academy is the best way to learn or remember how to control every type of train.Driver AssistHave you mastered driving diesel and electric locos, but struggled to control steam? Found it too complicated to drive or understand? Now you can master these delicate engines with our all new driving assist! Driver assist will provide you with real time information based on the locomotives performance and handling, it will guide you through driving a steam loco by highlighting the controls in cab and telling you how to move them to get the best out of the engine. Driver Assist is featured on all the steam locomotives included with the Riviera Line in the Fifties route and can be turned on and off at will.Train Simulator 2016 is out now and features the 60 Mile Sherman Hill route with UP Gas Turbine, ES44AC, SD70, SD40 and SW10 locomotives and freight wagons. The 40 Mile Riviera Line in the 1950s featuring the GWR Pannier Tank, Castle, Hall, King and Grange Class all with Driver Assist incorporated, Mk1, Collett and Centenary coaches and freight wagons. The 60 Mile West Rhine Railway from Cologne to Koblenz featuring the DB BR 155, 146.0, 146.2, 101 and 294, with regional and InterCity coaches and a variety of freight wagons.
