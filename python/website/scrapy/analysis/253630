It's such a brutal game and it makes it even more brutal that you didn't realize how brutal it is when you start. Then you realize you died because you made one, literally one, wrong move.”N/A – Indie Games AAA“Players must control their Steam Marines and try to get as far as possible through the ship’s elaborate, procedurally-generated levels. When I say “try”, I really do mean it.”N/A – The Wargamer												关于这款游戏							Steam Marines is a squad based Roguelike set on a steampunk spaceship.
