desc_long							评测						“Curse: The Eye of Isis is a fun, creepy, good looking horror game.”78% – IGN“The graphics are dripping with dark Victorian depravity. The environments look and feel old and worn and gloomy.”73% – GameZone“It's worthy of a spot in your collection beside Resident Evil and Silent Hill and should provide several good evenings of fright.”69% – Game Chronicles												关于这款游戏							Strange things are happening at Great Britain’s museum of natural history in 1890. A gang of ruthless thugs has broken into the establishment, the Eye of Isis Egyptian statue has been stolen, and a mysterious fog has overtaken a number of areas of the museum killing and transforming all it comes into contact with.In this survival horror game you will be playing as museum curator/archeologist Victoria Sutton and her childhood friend Darien Dane, you’ll have to fight the various beings and entities created by this fog. You'll spend considerable time in the museum, take a steam train to the coast and travel the seas in a huge cargo ship before finally entering the pyramid tomb where you must find and destroy the source of this ancient evil.
