Behind a sweet visual hides a title that shamelessly parodies Japanese RPGs”7.5/10 – Jeuxpo“The battle system is where Mugen Souls main strength lies. It’s turn based, where you have an area you can move about in and from there a smaller area you can attack in, this gets bigger/smaller for some skills and is fairly similar to a tactical RPG system, but in 3D and it feels a lot less restricted… The game performs really well too, I’m fairly below the minimum spec, but on the lowest setting I have next to no slowdown in game… Overall, it’s a nice little title.”7/10 – Otaku Gamers UK“Mugen Souls is a fun, fast-paced RPG with a goofy sense of humor and a million interlocking gameplay systems, and both makes fun of and feels like a throwback to a more traditional style of RPG”3.5/5 – Hardcoregamer (PS3 review)												关于这款游戏							Mugen Souls features a free-roaming battle map, turn-based combat, and massive amounts of customization and growth to maximize the fun players can have with the game.
