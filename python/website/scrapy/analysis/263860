desc_long							评测						“With Spacecom 11bit studios created perfectly working game mechanics which prove that you do not need elaborate animations to produce an immersive effect. I found Spacecom even more exciting and involving than most triple-A games recently. I would highly recommend it to all people who like good games.”9/10 – IGN Deutschland“Spacecom is simple, both graphically and mechanically—so simple it could almost be a board game.  And yet despite—or rather, because of—this unassuming exterior, there's a lot of depth for you to explore within a limited space. That's the kind of strategy I like! It's like playing an actual game of chess where each piece has a very defined set of rules versus a weird game of pseudo-chess where each pawn functions slightly differently and you won't really understand the point of half of them until you're fifty hours in.  We like to say "Graphics don't matter! Graphics don't matter!" Well, here's your proof. Just bring your imagination to the table, and there's a deeply satisfying strategy game waiting for you.”4/5 – PC World“Spacecom is exactly what I like. Challenging, smart, addictive, stimulating and yet not overloaded with unnecessary things. Flow Combine & 11 bit studios production represents the real meaning of strategy games and it’s essence. Every single fan of this genre, not only those with space theme, should check Spacecom.”8,5/10 – http://gry.onet.pl/recenzje/spacecom-recenzja-male-jest-piekne-a-jakie-madre/pw3gd													Game Demo									Not sure if you'll like the game?

There is none of the distraction of flashy visual effects or incredibly renderedenvironments, this is pure strategy.(...)
