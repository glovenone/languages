The mechanic is simple; eat smaller feesh to get bigger, and avoid being eaten by bigger feesh. Certain feesh have special abilities; Red ones make you smaller, and the jellyfeesh can sting you. Survive long enough, and you'll evolve! But try not to get naturally selected. And watch out for sharks.  Some feesh are more rude than others. Observe the behaviors of the different types of feesh to find out what they do! Or just find out the hard way. Uses Steam Leaderboards!
