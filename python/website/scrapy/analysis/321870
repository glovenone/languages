You play as a man called Jacob Reeves. A man who has lost his reason to live. He throws himself into a blackness to end his misery, but instead of it being the end he wakes up without a memory of his life before. You will travel through the abstract world of Silence of the Sleep to find the very reason for your journey...Now that is a good question! Here are some info about Silence of the Sleep that I believe are worth knowing: Side scrolling 2D with unique, digitally drawn graphicsUnique music from one end to another	Minimalistic interface -  I won’t hold your hand through the game	Challenging puzzlesNo shooting - Enemy encounters are pretty rare and you can’t kill the enemies, avoid and hide from them to surviveOriginal gameplay and twisting story - Silence of the Sleep has well crafted balance between horror and adventure, this allows me to build different atmospheres which brings variety to gameplayOne man game - Graphics, animation, coding, music... You name it!
