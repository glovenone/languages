It is being created by a team that includes: Richard "Lord British" Garriott the creator of the Ultima series, Starr Long the original Director of Ultima Online, and Tracy Hickman the author of the beloved Dragonlance Novels and Dungeons & Dragons modules.      Episodic Content: Shroud of the Avatar will consist of five episodes that will tell a series of virtue based stories created by Richard Garriott and Tracy Hickman. All supported by a series of prequel novels starting with Blade of the Avatar. Forsaken Virtues is the first episode (this is what you are purchasing access to).     Single Player Offline Mode: Players will adventure through over 40 hours of story in an interactive world where their choices have consequences, ethical paradoxes give them pause, and they play a vital part in weaving their own story into the immersive world and lore surrounding them.    Selective Multiplayer Modes: If you want to go through the story online you can play with everyone in a single world with three different online modes (Single Player, Friends, and Open).    Classless Character System: Vast customization options with hundreds of skills and spells in over 20 different skill trees.    Skillful Combat: A new way to prepare and fight in an RPG by building custom decks of skills and dynamically activating them in combat.    PVP: Consensual with Open PVP flags, zones, and Guild Warfare.    Player Housing: Non instanced, finite, and embedded in the world with multiple group living options.    Player Driven Economy: Deep crafting system where the best items are made by players and player items are the main source of loot found in the game.    Pay Once to Play: No subscription fees. Each episode (released approximately annually) is a one time fee and everything in  the game can be purchased with in game gold that can be earned (except for some exclusive backer rewards).     Social: Full Guild System, Highly Active Community and Player Owned Towns.    Crowd Sourced & Funded: Support the project by contributing content (and receive compensation) or by pledging (and receive exclusive rewards).    Open Development: Players help shape the game by giving feedback on monthly early access releases, videos, weekly updates, blog postings, forums, chat, etc.DEVELOPMENT ROADMAPShroud of the Avatar: Forsaken Virtues is currently in pre-alpha so there are a lot of features and content still to be built. Even the current content needs polish and balance. On the third week of every month we release a major update to the game that includes new features, new content, and bug fixes. We update the schedule for these on a quarterly basis with a final update for each release the day before it goes live.Current Version    Housing: Purchase property and a wide variety of buildings to place there. These can be customized with hundreds of items (paintings, crafting stations, chairs, tables, food, plants, fountains, statues, lights, etc.). Players can also set permissions that allow them to share this property with other players. Higher level pledges begin the game with property and house deeds.
