desc_long								关于这款游戏							... on that blindingly bright day ...... on that very day of winter ...This is a story of disease and suffering; of medication and adverse effects; of thoracotomy scars and cellular poisons; of the living who cannot help but to die and of the dying who cannot help but to live; of a resting place other than "on 7F" or "at home".This is a story of so many things.But most of all ...This is the storyof a girl whose heart was standing stilland a boy whose breath was being stolen away,both of whom die.
