desc_long								关于这款游戏							Do you have what it takes?Zero Reflex : Black Eye Edition is a psychedelic fast-paced game with a simple aim: you have 30 seconds to avoid deadly projectiles from a sadistic eyeball. EYE will do everything to kill you, and it includes rockets, shurikens, giant snakes, robotic tentacles and more! Surviving brings you to the next challenge, but don’t take it lightly: if you die, EYE will send you back to the previous level(s)!Why “Black Eye Edition”? Because the challenge of this version will punch you in the face really hard!FeaturesA new Psychedelic mode for a mind-expanding visual experience5 new levels wild deadly mechanics for a total of 25 unique environmentsA Training mode to muscle up your game before challenging the EYE4 difficulty levels: the further you go, the harder you are punished for your mistakesHistoryZero Reflex is a little game project with minimalistic and clear design but with very addictive and frustrating gameplay. Do you have what it takes? Fun Fact: the initial code name of the project was The Reflexx 2. Due to similarities with many other published games the team decided to go with the name "Eye Will Survive!" which is a pun title inspired by the song "I will survive" by Gloria Gaynor, which after the soft launch was again renamed into Zero Reflex.
