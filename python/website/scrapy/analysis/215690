desc_long									最新更新									Frame-rate Challenge Mode:Sometimes the internet leaks into games, and even Zeno Clash 2 can’t escape. In this unique challenge, surreal wireframe enemies begin spawning with increasing frequency. The enemies still require skill to beat, but the waves are only limited by one thing: the PC’s performance. Eking every last ounce of computational horsepower will be the key to surviving as long as possible in this highly unusual challenge. Coliseum Challenge Mode: This wave-based attack mode will push players to the limit. 50 waves of enemies will spawn, with increasing difficulty. True mastery of Zeno Clash 2’s first-person combat system of deadly combos will lead brawlers to victory, but there is some respite between rounds as players will have access to the store to buy weapons, power-ups, even allies. Unlike the game, there’s no restriction on the number of allies either, so get ready for the most intense, all-out, battle royale in all of Zenozoik.																							特别版									The Special Edition for Zeno Clash 2 includes:‘The Art of ‘Zenozoik’ digital artbookZeno Clash 2 Original Soundtrack																						关于这款游戏							Ghat's story is far from over: Zeno Clash 2 picks up where the deliciously brazen first game left off.
