It’s a game steeped in a bygone era of computer RPG design, but somehow it doesn’t feel archaic. Obsidian have always been bound to other peoples’ worlds—Fallout, Dungeons & Dragons, Star Wars, South Park—but in creating their own from scratch, they’ve made not only their best game to date, but one of the best RPGs on PC.”92/100 – PC Gamer												关于这款游戏							Pillars of Eternity:Prepare to be enchanted by a world where the choices you make and the paths you choose shape your destiny.
