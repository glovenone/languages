It’s got stunning visuals, intriguing lore, and a perfect variation of both levels and enemies. This was made in GameMaker. Yeah. Unbelievable.”8.5 – Decrypted Gaming“Sometimes, the best games you play come out of nowhere, with zero hype and zero notice. Trigger Saint was a game I had never even heard of, but as soon as I got my hands on it I was an instant fan. Challenging, rewarding and beautiful, even in it’s early access state, it’s a great title that really does deserve your attention.”N/A – Shoddy Pixels												关于这款游戏							Take on the role of Trigger Saint, mystic, hero, savior, legend, and wielder of the mighty Kuna Musket.

The city and our people were protected by a group of wise mystics. They trained in the art of inner spirit and wielded ancient weapons known as Kuna Muskets.The mystics lived on the edge of the city on platforms we called the "Sky Ways". Thought to be built from magic these platforms kept balance and if were ever lost the city would fall into eternal darkness.    They caught us off guard... floating demons inhabiting bodies of metal stormed the city under the light of the two crescent moons. We fought long and hard but their numbers were many, we could not hold them. They made their way into the city killing any in sight, thousands of Pithians slain within hours.I watched helplessly as my own mystic brothers were cast down in blood.    Luckily I was able to make it to the docks... me, your pregnant mother and and a couple hundred badly wounded Pithians escaped via airship.We would fly east to the floating mountains of Kiatu where we would remain in hiding for many years.    We now live in seclusion here on Kiatu, waiting for the day when the prophecy would be fulfilled. It is foretold that one day a young mystic would travel back to Pithia and reclaim it for his people, avenging his ancestors and ridding the city of evil. He would light the ancient beacon and signal the great exodus back to our home.Contact: Undergroundies@hotmail.com
