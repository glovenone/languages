Gameplay is extremely competitive and there are cup leagues, tournaments, cash prize events, a variety of team & squad based competitions. This completely free game also has a pretty interesting player community with its own history which is so in-depth that books could probably be written about it!The main developer of Continuum also created Skype - so you may not be surprised to learn that built into the game client is a sophisticated chat client which many Continuum addicts say is their way to talk to their buddies online! This allows players to very effectively communicate while in-play - or spectating gameplay - by joining a huge variety of chats or making up their own and using the games unique messaging system to effectively communicate with their team mates – and their enemies!There are eight unique ships to choose from in Continuum - their properties are different and depend on which game mode or event is being played – from a variety of hundreds – several of them are highly similar to modes from other games, examples include Team Fortress and Counter Strike which people experienced in shooter games may recognise well. A wide selection of in-game weapons and items exist including bullets, mines, decoys, thors-hammer bombs which can penetrate walls, burst - a fast spread of bullets which are a danger to any nearby ships, repels, and loads more. There’s much more to Continuum – far too much to fit here!So what are you waiting for!? Go ahead and download Continuum now and get in on the action!
