I found all those things compelling enough to drive me through the experience. This week, James recommends Enemy Mind.”Extra Credits“The two and a half months of Early Access time saw tweaks, updates, and bug fixes, and the payoff is an Enemy Mind that’s had a nice polishing shine applied to the game from front to back.”Hardcore Gamer												关于这款游戏							A retro shooter with a new power: the power to become any ship.Lost in the depths of space, you are a being of pure psychic energy with the uncanny power to take over and control anything you see in order to survive.

Indie Retro News  March 2014"The game really is the whole package. GameCola Score: 9 - Excellent"  GameCola  June 2014"Overall I was very impressed by what Schell Games was able to achieve with a genre that is not really known for innovation. The game is addictive enough that you will want to complete it a few times in order to piece together the whole story and of course the co-op mode will also eat up a lot of your spare time if you have friends nearby. While shooter fans will obviously enjoy the game the most I urge anyone that has an interest in polished, unique titles to try it out as it is definitely worth the effort. Rating: 8/10"  GAMERamble  June 2014"Enemy Mind is an excellent and unique take on the shooter genre. Definitely worth the price at full retail."
