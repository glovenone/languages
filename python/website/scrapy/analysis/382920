Solo hay que probar Retsnom para saber que es diferente y merece la pena...”8/10 – IGN Spain“RETSNOM est une perle sombre qui nous arrive droit d'Orient. Ne vous laissez pas tromper par son aspect "encore un autre platformer indépendant pixelisé". Il est riche, intéressant, exigeant, et en plus n'est pas très cher, que demander de plus ?”9/10 – OGaming TV“RETSNOM is a brilliant puzzle game that will have you thinking hard about what to do next.”8/10 – GameSkinny												关于这款游戏							"Have you ever looked into a mirror carefully? How do you know whether the person looking at you from the other side is yourself or someone else inside the mirror?"RETSNOM is an inventive pixel art puzzle platformer that allows players to break the map, by mirroring sections of the level, and rearranging it on the fly.You have a daughter. She is unfortunately infected by a zombie virus. The only way to save your daughter is to visit the future laboratory to steal the medicine that is expected to be made by your colleagues. But the future research team is hiding in the maze using mirrors. They decorated the maze using different features of a mirror in each level. Mirrors have several features.1. Mirrors seems to reflect objects left to right.2. Frost on the mirror's surface makes image invisible.3. Concave mirrors invert the image upside down. All of these rules are used to decorate puzzles. Players should understand the way how mirrors flip the world to solve the stages. The ability to bend the world to player's will is a very cool gameplay mechanic, that rewards experimentation as players make their way through this rather sinister world.
