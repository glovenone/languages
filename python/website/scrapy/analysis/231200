desc_long							评测						"Smart, thoughtful, sweet and incredibly well crafted – it’s the perfect game to play in the small hours of a lonely night. Be warned though; it’ll leave you hungry for unknown roads and longing for an invitation to the blues."Rock, Paper, Shotgun"Evokes the feeling of old ghost stories told around a campfire. There's the familiarity of friends and family around a warm, man-made fire, but with it comes the unnerving tale of the strange and unusual. Kentucky Route Zero is beautifully bizarre and perfectly poignant, and most of all, deserves your attention."9.5 - Destructoid"However you respond to its ethereal imagery, this is a game which makes a rare suggestion: who a player is may be more important than what they do."84/100 - PC Gamer													Steam Greenlight																															关于这款游戏							Kentucky Route Zero is a magical realist adventure game about a secret highway in the caves beneath Kentucky, and the mysterious folks who travel it.Developed by Cardboard Computer (Jake Elliott and Tamas Kemenczy), the game features an original score by Ben Babbitt, along with a suite of old hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers.The game is split into five acts. Acts I, II and III are available now. The remaining two acts will be released as they're completed. Taken as a whole, Kentucky Route Zero is roughly the length of a summer night.Key Features A focus on characterization, atmosphere and storytelling rather than clever puzzles or challenges of skill. A unique art treatment inspired by theatrical set design. A haunting score accompanies the ambient sounds of the bluegrass state. Wander the highways of Kentucky. Make some friends before morning.
