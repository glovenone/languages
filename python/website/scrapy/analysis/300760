desc_long							评测						“Epsilon emphasises both team play and tactics, with use of covert surveillance technology with interactive digital maps during a pre-mission planning phase and then squad based strategy during the mission itself.. where you need to bear in mind that while you may have laid out very careful plans, it can still go wrong!”N/A – May Contain Spoilers“There is a charm to seeing the bones of a game just being built, and certainly one as compelling as Epsilon.”N/A – Gaming Trend“Overall this is a solid effort from Serellan and with the tease of future features Epsilon will be an indie title that you should keep an eye on.”N/A – Front Toward Gamer													Announcing Operation Supply Drop Donations!									SERELLAN SUPPORTS OPERATION SUPPLY DROP CHARITY WITH 1,000 COPIES OF EPSILON AND SALES-MATCHING DONATIONSerellan, LLC - an indie game studio staffed by game industry veterans who previously worked on the critically acclaimed Shadows of Mordor, as well as the Ghost Recon, Halo, Killzone, and SOCOM series - is proud to announce they are partnering with leading military charity Operation Supply Drop to provide free game codes of their stealth-action tactical shooter EPSILON to active duty military and veterans.Serellan, whose CEO Christian Allen is a ten year veteran of the US Armed Forces (U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Air National Guard and U.S. Army National Guard), will donate a copy of EPSILON to Operation Supply Drop for every copy sold. An immediate one-thousand copy donation has already been made for distribution to deployed active duty service members and veterans in need of entertainment and cathartic activities.“I fondly remember playing games to relax with my fellow jarheads when I was in the service. Games like Masters of Orion, Command and Conquer, and Doom 2 helped us pass the time on slow days,” said Christian Allen, CEO of Serellan, LLC. “Now that I run a game studio, I wanted to find a way to give back to the services that helped boost my career, and Operation Supply Drop is the perfect partner for us. They have been incredibly supportive to the veteran community and those on active duty, and it’s an honor to contribute to their charitable operations.”“Partnering with Christian and Serellan is very exciting,” said Glenn “Commander” Banton, CEO of Operation Supply Drop. “As a veteran himself, Christian brings an authenticity to military-themed games and joins many others in our mission to support veteran-owned organizations. As Serellan continues to grow, we know it will serve as an inspiration to both active duty and veterans at home, and we expect many to follow in Christian’s boot-steps.”ABOUT OPERATION SUPPLY DROPFounded in 2010, Operation Supply Drop is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization that brings Veterans and Civilian Supporters together.
