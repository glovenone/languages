desc_long									Kickstarter and Free Prequel for a limited time									Hi everyone!In order to thank all the supporters who are helping us with our Kickstarter campaign, we decided to let you play our Prequel for free!This offer will last a month!If you want to contribute too and help us creating a better version of Elisa The Innkeeperhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2044603064/elisa-the-innkeeper																						关于这款游戏							Achievement support, a release for Macs and more text languages to choose from will be added in an update, coming soon."If I married all those who said they want me, now I would have so many of those husbands. All men who stay at this inn immediately fall in love with me..." Elisa Our visual novel introduces the story of Elisa, a beautiful owner of an inn, struggling with the amorous proposal of honorable Knights, high born Princes and rich Merchants.It will be the Player to decide Elisa's fate and his/her choices may even influence her destiny for the better or the worse. The Player is -not- the protagonist of this story, however.His/Her judgements affect every character and their actions, like a god that watches everything from above. For this reason, every decision is a tough choice to make.Your choice will change the story forever!  Our Prequel summarizes about 20% of our complete story and features 3 main story branches.The choices you make take account for the possibility of gaining special items; It's up to you to dicover them and when to use them.This allows you to influence the outcome of the story in a positive or negative way in specific situations, deciding how the story unfolds. Of course all of those features will play a much more important role once our story will be available in the future. The Prequel is just our first step!Hope you enjoy it!
