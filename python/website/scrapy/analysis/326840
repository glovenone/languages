Especially if you are a retro gaming fan, the graphics, art, and difficulty curve will keep you coming back for more to clean up the Robopocalypse.”95% – Gamer Assault Weekly“With tight refined combat, a charming visual style and an endearing main character that reminds me of an anthropomorphic companion cube, Heart & Slash’s throwback difficulty won’t be for everyone but, if you like your games to push back a little and not hold your hand, you’ll find Heart & Slash a rewarding experience that’s well worth the effort.”4/5 – Impulse Gamer												关于这款游戏							Heart&Slash is a 3D brawler that is set in a world where machines are all that remains from the Human civilization. You play as Heart, an innocent robot fighting to escape the grip of the evil and all seeing machine QuAsSy (Quality Assurance Systems).But make no mistake Heart&Slash is a hard game. Every death is permanent and means a new randomly generated level for you to start over with a different set of weapons and items you can use, new enemies to fight and secrets to explore.Heart&Slash is an indie game developed by a small but passionate team. We have a tiny budget but big hearts, and we are giving it all to make this game (our first) the best we can.Features (on final release):-3 worlds to explore and fight in. Each world includes its unique enemies an bosses.-Dozens of different weapons and equipment pieces (more than 100 in total) to customize Heart and your play style.-Perma-death, but a persistent progression system that gives you more options as you play the game.We hope you enjoy Heart&Slash as much as we enjoy making it!Welcome!
