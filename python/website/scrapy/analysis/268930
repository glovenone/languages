Check.”The Indie Game Magazine“As a huge fan of games like the Might and Magic series ... I am pretty excited for this game.”Capsule Computers“There’s a glowing green circle on the dungeon floor. Should I stand on it? Of course I should. Green means go. Nothing bad is ever green. So I step into the circle, and it poisons me. But look, that’s OK. Hit points are falling off me in clumps, like hair off the elderly, but over there on the wall is a font of pure, life-giving water. I race toward it and drink: it is also poisoned. Stumbling and reeling, I step back from the vile stuff onto a spike trap and die.”VentureBeat												关于这款游戏							Enter the world of Ahkranox - the first ever genuinely infinite first person roguelike.
