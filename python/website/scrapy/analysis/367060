desc_long								关于这款游戏							Helena The 3rd is a unique spin on the classic metroidvania style of game. While piloting a jumping tank, switch between 2D, 3D, and First Person perspectives as you search for upgrades for your combat vehicle. Blast your way through a series of interconnected, non-linear worlds, each with its own theme.Some areas won't be accessible by tank, and you'll need to exit the safety of your vehicle in order to acquire the abilities needed to progress through the game. So sit back, relax, and enjoy some retro inspired gameplay!
