You'll have to use your skill, wit, and reflexes, to complete all of The Howler's dozens of levels.  All art used in the Howler was meticulously created by classically-trained experienced painters.  The majority of the art was created is by Rene Petruliene: all the graphic design was drawn by hand, on paper, the old fashioned way. The Howler was inspired by Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. The game's locations and architecture actually exist in Vilnius today. Come to Vilnius to see them in real life!
