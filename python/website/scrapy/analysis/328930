Much horsepower needed to keep it airborne; learning the controls can be time-consuming. Microprose has scored a direct hit with it. If you enjoy modern air-combat sims, this is definitely for you.”88 – PC Gamer“Fleet Defender is pitched against the 'big boys', namely Falcon 3 and Tornado - and it holds its own on all fronts other than the just mentioned graphics. However, there's sufficient depth, realism and playability in the game to help you ignore the nightmare ripple effect.”86 – PC Zone												关于这款游戏							THE F-14 TOMCAT SIMULATION"Launch the Ready-Five, Launch the Ready-Five."The catapult officer calls for full afterburner. 50,000 pounds of thrust spools behind you as your F-14 strains for release.
