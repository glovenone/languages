This isn’t an all-out slugfest in which you must demolish the opposition to win the map. Win conditions are contingent on a number of objectives available in each scenario, and attempting to wipe out the opposition rather than fulfilling an objective will likely lead to a messy end for your troops. Or, worse, you'll simply run out of turns. It’s these stipulations and tabletop conceits that drive the core experience, and there is a lot to like about them. They provide a level of differentiation that helps make Fractured Empire feel like its own entity rather than just another turn-based futuristic war game.”Gameplanet“Membraine Studios feel that anyone with even the slightest interest in tabletop gaming will love Fractured Empire, and I tend to agree. However, I would broaden this statement. Turn-based strategy games have made something of a resurgence in recent times (think the XCOM: Enemy Unknown or the Shadowrun remakes) and Fractured Empire fits brilliantly into this trend. I would say that anyone interested in turn-based strategy -- or even just being able to command armies of bad-ass war machines -- will also enjoy this game.”Grab It Magazine“Ultimately, it’s an enjoyable and accurate adaptation of tabletop wargaming on PC, and a must-have for fans of the genre.”The Wargamer												关于这款游戏							Exodus Wars: Fractured Empire is a 3D turn-based strategy wargame that puts you in brigade-level control of futuristic infantry and armored companies, as well as huge super-vehicles.
