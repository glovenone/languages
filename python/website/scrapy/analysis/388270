Your involvement as GM does not stop in the team's front office. Baseball Mogul gives you complete control over your team on the field. You start by setting the starting defense, batting order and pitching rotation for your team. On game day, you choose your level of involvement. You can retire to the luxury box and make calls to the dugout as needed. Or you can take control of each player, choosing what pitches to throw and when to bunt or go for an extra base. A powerful game engine simulates each pitch of the game based on customized player ratings and over 100 years of historical data, assuring you the maximum realism possible! Baseball Mogul is designed to help you manage your team over many simulated years. Manage your team one day at a time, or let the computer simulate weeks or months at a stretch so you can play for virtual years or decades. As your players age, their abilities mature and decline realistically. Don't forget to build your team for the long term, rather than spending all your money on free agents this season. Watch your team rise and fall in the standings, watch your bank statement, and read the news stories to stay on top of what's happening with all the ball clubs in both leagues. If you pick the right players, manage your finances well, and stick to a winning strategy, your team may win the Championship, and you too may become a Baseball Mogul!New Features In Baseball Mogul 2015Build Your Own Expansion TeamUpdated minor league statsMore than 1.2 million lines of dataImproved simulation speed, accuracy and stabilitye.g. stolen base numbers no longer decline over timeImproved Trade AI (Artificial Intelligence)Trades improve teams at specific positions, not just overall talentImproved Player Award AI (Gold Gloves, etc.)Improved Pitch TrackingRecords velocity, break, location and result of every pitchAccurate head-to-head stats for every batter-pitcher matchupMore accurate heat maps in player Scouting ReportsMany bug fixes to prevent slowdowns and hangsProblems fixed with Baseball Mogul Encyclopedia outputPlus...Stat-based scoutingIndividual strategy settings for each playerIncludes individual pitch count limitsLefty-righty batting and pitching statsIncludes every season back to 1951Improved General Manager AI.Mimics real-life trade and contract dataScouting Report: copy player stats to clipboard with a single-clickMore realistic high school, college and minor league stats... and smaller improvements such as these:Free agents available after expansion draft, to help complete your major and minor league rosters.Bug fixed when calculating Defensive RunsNew stats and search options in "Sortable Stats" screenBug fixed with setting pitch count limits for individual pitchersGround balls to right side now advance runner on 2B more consistentlyNew directory created for each saved gamePrevents conflicts with box score and encyclopedia outputetc.Updates for Opening Day of the 2014 SeasonUpdated rosters for every teamComplete major league and minor league stats through 2013Actual real-life 2014 season schedule (all 2430 games)Backwards CompatibilityBaseball Mogul 2015 automatically loads databases from previous versions of Baseball Mogul.
