It’s two years of love and effort in the making, and it shows in every moment.”9.5 – Indie Game Magazine“Incredibly beautiful.”The Verge												关于这款游戏							Who hasn't dreamt, at some point, of filling a pool full of jello and swimming in it? In some of us, that dream never died. Some of us kept dreaming: what if the whole street was jello? Or the continent? The world!? The Floor is Jelly posits a universe made of jello, made purely for one's own amusement. No longer need we look to our walls and our floors and sigh, "How solid! How sadly immalleable! How I wish for a world consisting only of Non-Newtonian fluids!" That world has arrived, via the dark magic of videogames, as The Floor is Jelly.Soundtrack by Disasterpeace available here.
