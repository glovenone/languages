It's nerve racking, historically educational, deeply immersive, graphically unbelievable, awe-inspiring and a sim that proves once again an old axiom -- it's intense software that drives the development of intense hardware, no the other way around.”90 – GameSpy“I've been looking forward to this game since I first heard about a year ago. A game that allows you the chance to jump from station to station within a single B-17 has always been a dream of mine. And when I heard that Microprose was making this game, I jumped all over it. Each build that came my way received weeks of attention (which is just one of the reasons we don't have an Animorph's preview by the way). So now, after numerous delays and even a few cancellation rumors, the game is in stores. In short, it's everything I thought it would be -- chaotic, confusing and a lot of fun.”80 – IGN“When the average gamer thinks about flight sims, two primary styles readily come to mind. First is cruising over mountains and oceans at blazing speeds in an F-16 while dodging missiles and releasing chaff packets. The second is a far more technical branch of simulators. These products take great pains to reproduce every last physical force on the aircraft bodies, right down to vectored thrust and the effect of directional windspeed on flight times. While the first style is geared toward action lovers, the second has far more appeal to would-be pilots and people who have actual licenses. Each of these styles also has its own representative series which defines its genre based on the crucial differences. Action has the venerable Jetfighter series while realists might prefer something along the lines of Combat Flight Sim 2 or Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000. Past realistic flight combat games have had one crucial historic element missing.”80 – Adrenaline Vault												关于这款游戏							Feel the power of really flying a B-17!
