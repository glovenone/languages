Although it’s definitely not your atypical RPG it’s a refreshing game that offers a lot to those who give it an opportunity.  The game incorporates the traditional components of a JRPG in RPGMaker style but it also features critical components of an adventure and romance game as well.”Steamified“Nusakana is incredibly ambitious; it's a lengthy game with a lot of endings and because of the structure (or lack thereof) it'll take a long time to see everything. Despite the different ways to play the game in this updated version, it's still not something I'd call a "crowd-pleaser". Nusakana is a very niche title, but if you can deal with the slow pace, translation issues and a few odd design choices you'll find an interesting RPG with an unique Indonesian flavour.”3/5 – JRPG moe												关于这款游戏							A mysterious letter invites you to Nusakana island, an island south of the continent, promising to tell you of your past.
