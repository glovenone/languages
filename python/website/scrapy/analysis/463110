More of an interactive storybook than a traditional point-and-click adventure, the tale is told primarily through a text pane at the bottom of the screen, with static illustrations above and a verb list on the left. Everything that happens is described in the gentle style of a children's story, and the game promises that every action you can take will get a unique response.”Adventure Gamers												关于这款游戏							When Naigye and her niece Cally visit the castle, a surprise encounter with King Farnham leads to a short story about his three sons visiting a village of native lizard people.*Do you like, or at least, are able to tolerate:-Point-and-click adventure games?-Simple yet honest "old school" 216-color graphics?-An 800x600 windowed resolution?-The ability to go full screen with either stretched or un-stretched pixels?-A single EXE file that's less than 5 MB?-Lots and lots and LOTS of reading?-A unique response for every single possible interaction?-Lizard girls?
