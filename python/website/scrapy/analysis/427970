desc_long								关于这款游戏							Set in the distant future, man has evolved beyond flesh and bone and is now one with the machine. Your journey starts as a young Terran pilot, taking your first steps into the galaxy. You are free to join or form factions, corporations, bounty hunter gangs, or even crime syndicates as you forge your own story in a living, evolving galaxy. Whether you fly solo or with a massive fleet, take a role in government or start a corporation, the galaxy and game-play will respond in kind to your choices and performance. Design your own ShipsBuild your ship from an expanding array of parts in any of the 13 capital class categories. Research, manufacture, buy, steal and discover new parts. Assemble killer ships and even share them with your friends.Command & ControlReceive and issue tactical orders in real-time combat. Relationships, culture, and individual persona effect how your forces will respond to your orders.

From the agile corvette well under a hundred meters long to the huge Gar which can exceed 2,000 meters what you fly has a major impact on how you fly.Civilization ManagementBecome the leader of a world, system, sector, region or the whole galaxy!
