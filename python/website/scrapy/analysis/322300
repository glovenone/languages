You should only consider purchasing the Early Access for this title if you are okay with bugs, possible interruptions of service, and in some cases fluctuating features.In many ways The Repopulation is a throwback to the social aspects and sandbox driven gameplay that made titles like Star Wars Galaxies and Ultima Online successful. But it also integrates more recent innovations and introduces an array of its own unique wrinkles.The driving force behind this game is choice to play the game in the way that you want to play it. The choice to play the game like a traditional RPG or in a more action oriented style. To advance your character through combat or peaceful means.

Server AvailabilityBeing an MMORPG the only way to play the game is online. We currently provide both US and EU servers and they are available as long as there is no scheduled maintenance or unforseen issues that do arise during development and testing. We strive to keep the servers up and running as much as possible, but patching as with any MMOs is needed and will require the servers to be down during the process. There might be other times the servers are undergoing maintenance and will require downtime and we will try to effectively communicate this as much as possible.There are no current plans for player ran servers or single player options.3rd Party AccountThis game requires a 3rd party account to play. A key will be given to you by Steam to activate the account so you can see the list of available servers to play. Please be sure after you purchase the game to create your account and register the key.PackagesSteam currently has 2 package options available.Silver Package - Name Reservation, 1 Repop Token, Silver membership, and Early AccessGold Package - Name Reservation, 1 Repop Token, Silver and Gold membership, 1 day Head Start, and Early AccessAt some point before release the Memberships will be enabled in game and offer the following: Additional Character Slots, Inventory Slots, Bank Slots, Shared Bank Slots, Mission Slots, and Auction Slots.
