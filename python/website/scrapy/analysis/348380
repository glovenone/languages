desc_long								关于这款游戏							'The Interview' is an experimental experience. It's not about "what" is the Interview, it's about "why". The Interview will ask you questions, will make you decide and you will answer them. But it's not as simple as that. It's not just an interview. Your name is Adam. You're searching for a job. You walk into a white room while a voice tells you to sit in the red chair. You really don't know anything but your name. So the room starts with the experiments. Are you left-handed or right-handed? Black or white? But things start to get weirder and weirder until you realize what's going on. Everything is related to the red box. That red little box.
