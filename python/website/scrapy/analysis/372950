desc_long								关于这款游戏							Is your child curious about the world? Do you want your kid to discover the answers for bothering questions on its own? After all, the most effective way of learning is exploring instead of receiving ready solutions! This is the reason, why we’ve created Professor Why Chemistry™ - the game, which teaches through play and enables players to run chemical experiments at home. However, you don’t need money for reagents or chemical apparatus. Your kid won’t be exposed to the damaging influence of chemicals, because experiments will be carried out virtually - thanks to the Augmented Technology (AR) which we implemented in our game. But you don’t need to buy expensive sensors to use the AR, the only thing you need is simple webcam or even mouse! Playing with Professor Why Chemistry™ will enable your child to reach out for knowledge which is right in front of him, literally.Print out edu-cards (for Augmented Reality mode):http://professor-why.com/edu_cards/
