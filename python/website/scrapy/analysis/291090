desc_long							评测						“It’s a game about seeing the other side, but raw and unsympathetic rather than didactic or apologetic. It’s a game about how we’ll feel the world’s out to get us, no matter whether we’re customer or operator. It’s a game for everyone.”Rock Paper Shotgun“As mind-numbing and soul-draining as the game (and customer service in general) tend to be, any game whose ultimate lesson turns out to be, just maybe, be better to each other, is an experience worth having.”7/10 – Gamespot												关于这款游戏							The green light flashes; another caller is on the line. You can tell right away it's going to be one of those calls... he's got a simple request, but you're caught between the bureaucracy that requires a gauntlet of security questions and a person who can barely remember his last address.It would be so easy to let things slide. Just ease him through the questions, give him a hint or a nudge... or maybe you're done putting up with this. Your tolerance is shot and you're just not going to hold back on the snark. But either approach could end disastrously. You need this job. Features:A branching narrative pulled from personal experience.Over 250 lines of fully-voiced dialogue.STEAM-EXCLUSIVE achievements and trading cards.
