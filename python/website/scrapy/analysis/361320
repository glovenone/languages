They all have one thing in common: cash to spend.As you grow to own hotels and casinos you'll want to set the amount of floor space given to rooms, bar and restaurant areas, roulette, card tables, slot machines, entertainment lounges, and to also set the level of payouts, profits and cream offs on the tables and machines. You will be able to see, in high detail, which of your outfits are popular.
