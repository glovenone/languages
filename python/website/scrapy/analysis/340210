desc_long								关于这款游戏							Predestination is a turn-based sci-fi 4X game set in the distant past of our own galaxy. Ships from countless races are sent back in time by an enemy known as the Revenants, and must now work to rebuild their empires. Explore the galaxy, colonise habitable worlds, meet alien races, and wage war. Predestination aims to blend the gameplay of classic titles like Master of Orion II with more modern 3D graphics and new game mechanics 4X fans have been waiting years to get their hands on: A 3D galaxy map, tactical fleet combat, advanced planetary exploration, terraforming, and many other features.HistoryIndependent game development studio Brain and Nerd was founded in January 2012 by Queen's University Belfast graduate Brendan Drain and Tina Lauro, and work immediately began on Predestination. When it became clear that Predestination would need some funds to continue development, a campaign for the title was launched on Kickstarter in November 2012. The team asked for $25,000 US to pay for tools and basic living expenses for the core team and were overwhelmed with the positive response. The campaign ended with over $50,000 in backing via Kickstarter and direct PayPal pledges. A second Kickstarter was spurred on to capitalise on a £10,000 grant given to Brain and Nerd by The Arts Council of Northern Ireland as a part of it Creative Industries Innovation Fund. This money, combined with the additional $20,000 raised in the second Kickstarter campaign, secured a standalone 3D ship designer for Predestination.Testing and Current BuildFollowing the successful Kickstarter campaigns, development on Predestination proceeded at a smooth pace. Each feature has been individually tested by our dedicated beta backers, and the game is now at the point where it has been joined together into a cohesive playing experience. This is by no means a finished product, and should be treated as Predestination's first alpha build. We are hoping that with your support and continued feedback, Predestination can become a feature-complete package very soon and we can begin polishing it for final release. If you do not enjoy testing new products produced by dedicated indie developers, the Early Access may not appeal to you and you may be happier adding the game to your wishlist and keeping tabs on development through our regular development updates. We will not stop until it's completed to our satisfaction, of course, and we are excited to see where the final few months of development take Predestination.Plans for the FutureBrain and Nerd has already committed to supporting Predestination long after release. We sold Free DLC for Life as a reward tier during our Kickstarter campaigns and have promised at least one expansion and several DLC packs, and we reached stretch goal tiers to add multiplayer and modding tools. We have some very exciting plans for this future content, such as biotechnologies and living ships, and constantly turn to our community for ideas, so stay with us and keep an eye on the forum for more news.
