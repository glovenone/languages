desc_long								关于这款游戏							A turn-based strategy game pitting two players of Light and Shadow against each other with asymmetric forces and hidden units. For Light to be victorious, the player must sneak the Prince to the Shadow Stronghold. Shadow, on the other hand, is tasked with finding and defeating the Prince (Or moving 3 characters into the Light Capital). Like many of Reiner’s designs, The Confrontation can be played casually between beginners or as deeply as master level chess: it’s up to you and your opponents! GAME FEATURES  Solo play versus multiple AI opponents.  Realtime online multiplayer.
