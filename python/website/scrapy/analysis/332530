desc_long							评测						“Developer Neon Deity Games' spirited rejection of video-game balance almost qualifies as avant garde, but Shutshimi's emphasis on high scores begs for comparisons to great arcade fare such as Galaga, Xevious, TwinBee, and Fantasy Zone.”Highly Positive – Slant Magazine“It's an unending treasure trove of laughter and frantic fun...”Highly Positive – IndieGames“Rather than trying to fit itself into a specific genre category, Shutshimi aims to make the existing genre fit around it. It's a bold statement to make, but it's one that the game's developers are able to pull off with aplomb.”A- – Gaming Age												关于这款游戏							Shütshimi is a randomized shoot'em up about a muscle-bound fish with memory problems defending the seven seas.Armed with your trusty bullet-morphing shotgun, defeat or navigate through waves of enemies and collect powerups as you battle your way through each of the game's bosses. But there's a catch (there's always a catch): you've been cursed with an incredibly short attention span. Combat waves and upgrade cycles only last 10 seconds a piece, so you'd better act fast!But wait, there's more (information)!Fishy Features:    Endless waves, endless fun!    Rapid-fire gameplay! The rules change every 10 seconds, so react quickly!    5 different weapons to choose from!    Over 40 upgrades to acquire! Combine upgrades with different weapons for interesting combinations!    Hats! Over 30 of them! Most hats unlock hidden "Hattributes" which modify gameplay even further!    Full keyboard and controller support! Play any way you like, as long as it's either of these two options!    You can smoke underwater!?    Leaderboards! Compete with friends and foes for the global top score!    Local Co-op! Work together or screw each other over when competing for the top score
