A game where your sister can convince you that your hovercraft is full of eels and your hat is silly! You should always look on the bright side of life - even the harshest insult can be classy when said over a cup of tea. So track down a best friend, and enjoy the greatest local 1v1 multiplayer insult simulator game of the century!The game was created in 42 hours during the amJam game jam event hosted by Artifex Mundi.
