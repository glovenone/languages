desc_long								关于这款游戏							Sydney's World is a family-friendly JRPG. Game focus is on the intersecting story arcs of a young girl seeking her father and a king in search of redemption.Sydney is a somewhat feisty eight year old who loves snacks, hates egg salad, and occasionally gets embarrassed by her lovable dad. When she is captured by an evil wizard and transported to another world, her toy elf Snowball is brought to life. Together, they stop small dogs from barking, cause a king to reconsider his philosophy, and deal with very real emotions in a fantasy world setting. Explore new worlds without the usual multitude of boring side-quests and random encounters with identical enemies. There are no maps, mini-maps, mini-mini maps, or micro-maps; exploration is done the old-fashioned way, with clues and logic.Sydney and villains are voice-acted to enhance engagement. Other characters are not, to encourage reading and imagination. There is no profanity, blood/gore, sexual content...or even more damaging to young minds...lame dialogue and cheap endings!Older, wiser players will enjoy unconventional aphorisms that might cause them to reconsider their own philosophy. Hard-core RPG gamers should note that there is no inventory management or traits/abilities/skill point management.
