The game itself supplies many tools that make managing your economy easier so that you can focus more on crushing your enemy than of playing simcity in your base. Units interact using realistic physics and varied terrain (you can actually micro units in order to dodge projectiles!).Below is a very short list of the features that Evolution RTS has to offer:Realistic PhysicsProjectiles and units use a realistic physics system which allow for unprecedented control and gameplay.
