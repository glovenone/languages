Luckily, Hordelicious came along, and brought with it not only interesting mechanics, but a good bit of silliness as well.”IndieGames“The challenging gameplay endows Hordelicious the excitement a shooting game should have.”Hao Gamers72% – Mouse N Joypad												关于这款游戏							Get ready to rock!

We knew about the life forms of the planet, but what we didn't know was that these creatures actually worship the planet itself.

You have to forget our original plans and fight your way out of there!Features:- Over 45 unique weapons - A plethora of items of upgrades  - Epic boss battles- Achievements to unlock- Levels with multiple variations
