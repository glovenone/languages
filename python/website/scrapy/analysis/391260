desc_long								关于这款游戏							Labyronia is an epic RPG, heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VI, and the Dragon Quest series.  When your world is invaded by mysterious creatures, the very survival of humanity is at stake.  Some believe these creatures are gods, descending down on the earth to punish humanity for its cruel and wicked ways.  Others believe them to be malevolent invaders from beyond the stars.  It's up to you to discover the truth behind these creatures' origins and save humanity from their wrath.It's widely believed that the secret to defeating these monsters lies in temples that appeared, scattered throughout the world, 50 years prior.  Journeying to these temples, across the harsh, hostile landscape will require intense skill, cunning, and might.   Unearthing the secrets inside will be a challenge akin to the most hardcore JRPG's of the 16 bit eras.Can you harness the power to defeat the gods?
