Which sounds weird, I know, but trust me, it works.”Kotaku“Overall, there is very little that can be faulted about Concrete Jungle and it is a must-have title for anyone with even a passing interest in the genre.”GameRamble												关于这款游戏							A city planning deck-building game!Concrete Jungle is a new take on the city building genre that swaps micro-management for a more strategic and puzzle-orientated style of city planning.You have a deck of selected cards which you can use to place buildings. Each building will affect it's surroundings in different ways. The aim of the game is to clear city blocks by gathering the required number of points from your residents, giving more room to build.
