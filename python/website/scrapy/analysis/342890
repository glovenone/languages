desc_long							评测						“Synonymy is about the blurry edges of words that make carefully choosing them so much fun, the slight inflections you can add to draw connections.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun												关于这款游戏							Synonymy is a non-profit, educational word game narrated by Richard Dawkins where players are challenged to find a path between random words through their network of synonyms. By taking the synonym of a word, and then a synonym of that synonym, and so on, you can ultimately arrive at any other word in a language.The game supports multiplayer, and weekly challenges in which users can compete globally on set start and end words. Every time a path is uncovered by a user, it is tweeted from @synonymygame and posted to our Facebook page. All profits go to educational charities. A visualization of the game's network can be seen here -- http://tinyurl.com/med6g8b -- In order to compute relative distance, all synonyms were mapped using 3d graphing software, as if each word were a planet that had a gravitational pull proportional to its number of relationships to other nodes. Above is a 2D representation of that model, a 40,000 x 40,000 rendering.Music by Daduk
