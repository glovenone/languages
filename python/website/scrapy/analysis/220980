desc_long							评测						“CRYENGINE is, for my money, the best looking and most full-featured engine currently available.”Chris Roberts, Founder and CEO, Cloud Imperium Games“It’s safe to say we literally could not have done this game with any other engine without a drastic reduction in the scope of our project; the size of our maps, the level of detail. We set out to make a world that was breathtaking to look at, and that’s what you see in-game. It’s a relationship we hope to grow in the future with more games!”Turtle Rock Studios“We looked at every major technology out there and CRYENGINE suits our needs perfectly.”Martin Klima, Executive Producer, Warhorse Studios												关于这款软件							Crytek's groundbreaking development technology is now more accessible than ever! For just 9.90 USD/EUR per month, developers everywhere can subscribe and gain total access to the industry-leading feature set of CRYENGINE without ever having to pay licensing fees or royalties! About CRYENGINECRYENGINE (previously known as CryENGINE 3) is the first all-in-one development solution with truly scalable computation and benchmark graphics technologies. With CRYENGINE, developers are fully equipped to create standout game experiences, using the engine behind games like Ryse: Son of Rome and Crysis series.The famous CRYENGINE Sandbox editor is a production proven, third-generation real-time tool suite designed and built by AAA Developers. All development features of a CRYENGINE game can be produced, edited and played immediately with the “what you see is what you play” (WYSIWYP) system. The engine deals with the instant conversion and optimization of assets in real-time, enabling cross-platform changes to all elements of the game creation process. This increases the speed and quality of development, while significantly reducing the risk of creating multi-platform games. For more information on CRYENGINE, visit the CRYENGINE website.
