A fully voice-acted, funny, cartoon point and click adventure.Journey to the Apnea Swamps to face the menacing but lethargic Bed Bugs. Escape the depths of the Termite Mound prisons and the jaws of the towering termite soldiers. Fight back against the powerful and scheming fire ants.

Marvel at the illustrious plant-life, like the ketchup and mustard plants, magnet flowers, mattress-shaped water lillies and illuminating light bulb vines. All this with tons of unique puzzles that tease your brain but have just the right amount of casual difficulty. Ballads is based on the world and characters of the hit web game series The Several Journeys of Reemus and tells a completely new story.
