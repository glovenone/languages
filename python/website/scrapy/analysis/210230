With cunning deceptions, cave-ins and cobras aplenty, the game's got the right balance of scary but not too scary.”– USA TODAY“Her Interactive has clearly done extensive research to create puzzles, events, and characters that are authentic and faithful to the world of archeology in Egypt while taking creative liberties where appropriate. Most of the puzzles require knowledge of Ancient Egyptian culture, all of which is imbibed in game. I applaud this studio for entertaining me and making me feel like an Egyptologist simultaneously.”– GameZebo												关于这款游戏							Enter the Cursed Tomb of the Lost Queen!
