Exciting and varied quests will lead you through the story of Trinium Wars. Special instance missions let you control Tanks, Mechs or even Monsters. As high level content up to 1000 players can simultaneously fight in the “Resource War” mode, build up camps and mine precious Trinium. For fast PvP fun Trinium Wars offers an additional MOBA style Arena mode while the base-building mode will allow for more tactical choices and the chance to craft new equipment, potions and even skills.

They earn Battle Points by defeating their foes. Battle Points can be used to buy tanks, helicopters and robots to transform into and lead your allies to battle.

Base Building Mode: Each user can build his own base in a 2D style similar to popular browser strategy games.

It quickly escalated into all-out nuclear war, which rendered Earth a radioactive wasteland.Nothing but rubble was left on Earth. A few survivors of this apocalypse escaped from the lifeless ball of rock that was once their Planet to lick their wounds among the stars until their planet would be recovered.Meanwhile, in another system of the galaxy, the Narc were forced to leave their home planet as they were close to depleting its resources. So they started a desperate voyage to the stars. At last, they found Earth, a planet rich with their most precious resource - Trinium.They set up camp on the southern hemisphere and built a strong foothold from where they could start gathering the previously unmined material.But Earth was not uninhabited: Humans who were left behind and exposed radioactive mutated to… something else. Mutants settled in the ruins and conquered Earth.After 200 years, as the radiation levels slowly dropped, Humanity returned with the aim to rebuild and reclaim all that was lost in World War III, only to find that their rightful home had been occupied by alien forces.Now 3 factions compete for dominance over the planet. Who will come out victorious in this conflict? The cunning humans, the noble Narc or the savage Mutants?Contents of the Deluxe Edition:This is a great bundle for new Trinium Wars Players - over 30EUR/USD value and exclusive Items!inventory upgrade 4 slots, warehouse upgrade 10 slots, Premium Mount7.500 Cash CurrencyStarter Pack:Beginner Powerpack (Increase HP, speed) 200ea 50 HP 2400 recovery ampoule Experience Bonus 25% (7 days)Ring of Queen rose : HP+62  Auto looting service 1ea (7days)Item Drop Rate Bonus  1 ea (7days)Contents of the Collector's Edition:This is the ultimate bundle for the Trinium Wars Player - over 80EUR/USD value and exclusive Items!inventory upgrade 12 slots, warehouse upgrade 15 slots, Premium MountExclusive Steampunk Costume15.000 Cash CurrencyStarter Pack:Beginner Powerpack (Increase HP, speed) 200ea 50 HP 2400 recovery ampoule Experience Bonus 25% (7 days)Ring of Queen rose : HP+62  Auto looting service 1ea (7days)Item Drop Rate Bonus  1 ea (7days)Platinum pack: Experience Bonus -25% (30days)Crome Bonus - 20% (30days)Item Drop Rate Bonus - 20% (30days)Premium Auction Service (30days)Automatically Loot Service (30days)Resurrection Capsule 5 ea
