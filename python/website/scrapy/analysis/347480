Those who like a progressively difficult game would love this.”7.8 – ReviOUYA“Combine this with the fact that Super Pixalo’s level design and precision timing needed to make it to the next level  is a major challenge in itself and you have one very tricky game to try and navigate.”OUYABrew												关于这款游戏							Super Pixalo is the story of a pixel from a 1960s Rock & Roll themed arcade cabinet.
