The art and music work great together and really help to make the game feel fluent and cohesive. I had a great time controling time with Team Indie and give it 8.5 out of 10!”8.5 / 10 – Glitch“I wasn’t quite sure what to expect booting up Team Indie for the first time and boy was I in for a pleasant experience. Boasting over 50 levels, featuring 10 of the best loved indie video game characters ever and brimming with some of the most creative and innovative level design, if you are a platforming game fan, it would be a shame to miss out on this one.”10 / 10 – http://www.thatvideogameblog.com/2014/10/17/review-team-indie-pc/													Team Indie nominated for German Game Developer Award 2014									Team Indie has been nominated for the German Game Developer Award 2014 in two categories.
