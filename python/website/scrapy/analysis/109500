desc_long								关于这款游戏							A heroic rooster sets forth on a ridiculous space adventure to DESTROY THE SUN! Unfortunately for him, a legion of lingerie-loving Vikings has turned it into their headquarters and they’re big fans of fried chicken. Full of high tech weaponry, constant non sequitur, terrible gaming humor and a wanton disregard for anything wholesome; Fowl Space is a crazy journey you’ll never forget... to say the least. Key Features5 insane weapons including exploding kittens, unspecified white goo, and a killer whale flail.5 stages of complete and utter randomness in the center of the sun.9 challenge levels that are homages to other awesome indie games.Terrible gaming humour and relentless abuse of memes throughout.
