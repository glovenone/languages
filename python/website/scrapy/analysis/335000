Every aspect is impressive on its own and when all of its elements are combined, a truly worthy gaming experience is born. For fans of the genre or horror games in general, this game won't disappoint.”9/10 – Game Walkers“Every single piece of art is absolutely stunning and the gameplay complements it well. It has a perfect length for what it is and the world stays with you well after you’re finished. Tormentum is one of the most strikingly visual adventure games and the small team at OhNoo Studio should be proud of what they’ve made.”9/10 – Pixel Related“All clearly inspired by the nightmarish flesh-stretching surrealism of HR Giger with occasional hellscapes in the style of Hieronymus Bosch, Tormentumis never less than amazing to look at and the push to see the next piece of f***ed-up artwork is what drove me on through the game the most.”7/10 – Game Watcher												关于这款游戏							TORMENTUM is a dark Point & Click adventure game.The dreamlike, nightmarish atmosphere of the game was inspired by works of painters H.R. Giger and Zdzislaw Beksinski. The game's final look and feel was also strongly influenced by the universes of games such as Demon's Souls or Dark Seed.
