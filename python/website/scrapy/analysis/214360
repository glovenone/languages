Previously Updated									Introducing the all new co-op mode!High above the clouds, there drifts a sad, derelict remnant of a once lively little drifter town... it was ruthlessly attacked by pirates intent on sacking the plump little plum in the sky, but in their greed they sank their own ship under the weight of the first load of plunder!  A tempest wind soon thereafter arrived, driving the now un-manned island town far from where it had laid anchor for trade.  The inhabitants had hastily fled during the pirate attack, but  in so doing left all of their goods, munitions, and rum.... LOTS OF RUM.  During one of his many pleasure cruises in his glorious, kingly dirigible, the KING happened to stumble across the abandoned stockpile.  He immediately seized the derelict under his sovereign authority, claiming the rum (and other less important supplies) for his own reserves.   BUT!!  Providentially, the surviving pirates of the pillaging snafu had regrouped and showed up just shortly after the KING set up base, and thus found their long-lost gem in the hands of a belligerent, crown-waving buffoon.  Having tasted some of the finest rum of the barrels his fat arse now reclined upon, their course of action was clear...  This meant WAR!”Key FeaturesJoin up with your friends to protect the rum in the new 1-3 player co-op map, Royal Rum-Bowl!Adjust and rebuild your maze after enemy pirates bomb, smash and utterly destroy your towers with randomized enemies and events!Compete in 3 new leaderboards for solo, duo and trio scores!Enjoy other goodies like a new environment, achievements and music!Featuring the new and improved steel plate hex, state-of-the-art craftsmanship of the KING’s own forges!
