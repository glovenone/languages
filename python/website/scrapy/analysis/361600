She is alone... or is she?

There are no tutorials. How the game progressesThe game starts with Luna being rather weak.As the game progresses, she gets upgrades to her existing abilities - for instance - running and jumping powers on the first level. On the second level, she gains a double jump ability which can be used to gain speed, halting mid-air or overcoming obstacles.Each skill you unlock can also be used to play previous levels and maybe access new areas within levels!Don't forgetIt is helpful to read the Hints on each level. They are accessed through the pause menu - press ESC on keyboard or the start button on your gamepad.
