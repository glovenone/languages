Compete in epic battles with hundreds of units using weapons, magic and tactics. Hire new units and customize their load-outs with items you have collected. Combine items together to make them stronger and give yourself an edge in combat. Can you find the enemy's weak spot and exploit it? Are you able to react accordingly to counter your opponent's strategy?Game ModesIn Shadow Heroes, you play through a series of battles that escalate quickly and vary depending on your choices. Based on the game mode, you will have different objectives.    Commanders - Eliminate the enemy commanders who inspire nearby units with their powerful aura abilities.    Onslaught - Survive against all odds versus an increasingly powerful enemy force.Single player / Multiplayer ExperienceShadow Heroes has a Skirmish mode that allows players to familiarize themselves with both of the available game modes in a single player experience. In the Commanders game mode, they will fight against an AI commander with up to 5 difficulty settings, which are adjustable inside of the game settings. At the end of every match, you will gain a number of items for a victory, determined by the level of difficulty you have selected. Multiplayer matches of the Commanders mode really put your abilities to the test, as a result, each victory gives you the best rewards.In Onslaught, players will be defending against a constant assault of enemy forces. Positioning and strategy will be key in your success. The longer your defenses last, the better the rewards you will receive. You will also have access to the powerful defensive cannons of the keep. These cannons have a 5 minute cooldown, but will severely damage incoming forces in a large area. When multiplayer becomes available for Onslaught, it will be the first co-op game mode, allowing you and a friend to share in the glory of defending the keep, how far will you make it?Everything you find, craft and equip goes with you through both your single player as well as multiplayer adventures. If you're struggling with players online, work towards better items in skirmish and vice versa.Active / Passive ItemsShadow Heroes has two types of items in it: Active and Passive. Passive items provide bonuses to your unit's stats and in some occasions, abilities that the AI will use automatically. Using passive items is a great way to boost the overall effectiveness of your army without adding to your workload.       Active items on the other hand only provide bonuses when you select the unit with the item and activate it. You may also mass select your units in order to activate those items for that specific group at the same time. These effects usually come with some added bonuses or additional control like being able to focus down individual targets. The down side is that they are a lot of extra work and are hard to use efficiently! If you are up for the challenge, they can really help turn the tides of a battle.What makes “Shadow Heroes: Vengeance in Flames” different from other RTS games?We kept looking at games that were thoroughly popular and found the common denominator to be “simple and fun”. The Real Time Strategy genre has great potential to reach the masses of gamers, but never truly bridged the gap to those who were not complete fans of this particular play style.At Allied Games, we tried to bridge that gap. We wanted to make a game that everyone would be able to have fun playing regardless of skill level or game style. A lot of the time, you have to sacrifice things to make your game successful. That is one thing we did not want to do. The appeal has to be equal to everyone, whether you are a: casual gamer, hardcore gamer, competitive gamer, etc.Unlike the traditional gameplay everyone is used to when hearing the term RTS, we are trying a different approach. Many non-RTS players get overwhelmed by the amount of choices that go into a simple match. Do they focus on gathering resources? Do they focus on building up their army? What about researching technology? These are core elements that regular RTS players are so used to that they no longer think about, it has become instinct to them. As such, they will always have the upper hand if they were to play against someone less versed in the genre. Our approach allows both of them to play on a leveled playing field.Trying to cater to everyone is no easy task, but it is something we are very passionate about. We are always on the lookout for comments, input, suggestions, or just plain talking about this project to us. Our goal is to bridge the gap and we will do everything in our power to make sure all gamers are able to enjoy the project we have poured our hearts and souls into.
