But there's something about the loneliness of being a down quark all alone in a subatomic space that really underlined the joy in finding an anti-down quark to combine with.”The Guardian“The game feels fantastic. It’s a joy to whiz around the simple environment. This game illustrates the idea that a game doesn’t have to be visually packed to look good; indeed, its artistic style is reminiscent of flOw.”Kotaku AU“It’s a story-led, arcade puzzle game that seems to have a lot of intelligent thought about it.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun													Are you a Supporter or Devotee?
