That is why we play games, right?”Alex Coccia, Greenlit Gaming“By the end of a run-through you will be left breathless and your brain buzzing as it slows back down to reality.”Tom Christiansen, Indie Game Mag“The production values are top-notch, especially for a game that comes with such a low price tag.”Matt Suckley, God is a Geek													特色列表									OVER-THE-TOP JOUSTING! - Countless enemies had been shot, hacked and slashed in the history of games. Now it is time to ram a wooden lance in some gut, send your foes flying, and watch them bite the dust! Body parts ripping off, ragdoll horse physics, and destructive environments included.A BEAUTIFUL BRUTAL WORLD – Dive into a magical fantasy world full of treasures and adventures! Don't be fooled by the cartoony looks: here, simply bumping into a silly wooden fence spells a sudden end to your hero's life. If you fancy dying in a more heroic way, how about getting swallowed by a giant toad, falling into a lava pit, exploding from eating too much turkey, getting impaled by a Hitler Snowman, or just getting lit on fire by a dragon!BUCKETLOADS OF CONTENT – Divided into three major parts - the Story Mode, the Endless Journey Mode and the Rogue Rider Mode - this game has a lot to offer and there is always something new to accomplish, find, or unlock. Power-ups, characters, view modes, mutators, quests, game mode variations, randomly generated hats, you name it! Did you ever wish to be a skeleton king with a fancy wig riding over rainbows on a flower-pooping pink unicorn? It's all up to you in this game!INSPIRED BY CRASH BANDICOOT – Good third-person platformers were always hard to find on PC, when consoles sport countless shining examples: the first Crash Bandicoot titles, Spyro, Ratchet & Clank, and Super Mario were all a big inspiration for Last Knight. This game kicks it up a notch with non-stop jousting action, no-health instant death, procedurally-generated worlds, as well as custom-crafted levels with Knightmare levels in-between. To top it off, the new Rogue Rider Mode pushes it all into a rogue-like direction, and if you don't like third-person view, try playing in first-person mode!																						关于这款游戏							Last Knight is a unique genre mix that combines platforming, action-packed ridingand ragdoll physics driven jousting!
