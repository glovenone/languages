desc_long									Soundtracks!									We know how hard it is to wait for release day, so in the meantime we thought we'd share our Soundtrack with you!Our incredibly talented composers have created some great music for 404Sight. Check out 404Sight Soundtrack Part 1 http://gabecastro.bandcamp.com/album/404sight-soundtrack and 404Sight Soundtrack Part 2!http://keatonanderson.bandcamp.com/album/404sight																						关于这款游戏							404Sight is a free game made in support of net neutrality. It’s a 3D playground runner influenced by parkour running with the addition of a special ping ability that reveals areas that can speed the player up or slow them down. Hidden fast and slow lanes become visible, so it takes a bit of planning to plot a course through a world full of hazards – especially when the internet service providers themselves are actively trying to impede the player’s progress. In 404sight, the player attempts to traverse a level as quickly as possible without getting throttled by the ISPs, who actively throws slow tiles and inhibitors in their way.This game was made by Retro Yeti Games, a team of graduate students currently enrolled in the Entertainment Arts and Engineering program at the University of Utah.
