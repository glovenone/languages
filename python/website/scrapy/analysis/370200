Honestly, you rarely even see games in the genre that take the time to provide animated sprites! The unique, frightening storyline stands out against its colleagues as well. If this review got you interested then definitely seek out Two Steps Back for yourself and unravel its mysteries.”Cliqist												关于这款游戏							Play as Therese, who's somehow found herself unable to leave a cathedral that she doesn't remember entering. Things only get stranger when a young boy, Eldin, who Therese has never met claims to know her. Eldin claims that the two of you are sharing a dream-- a dream that neither of you can wake up from. What can you believe? Who can you trust? Dive in and try to uncover the secrets hidden within, and outside, of your dreams...This visual novel features:+Over thirty unique illustrations+Seven original music tracks+Fully animated character sprites+Two full length parts to the story+Over one hundred pages of dialogue+Bilingual in both English and GermanCredit to Simon Schonberg for the German translationCredit to www.soundfxnow.com for the soundeffects----Important Notice----As of now everything should be running smoothly, but please contact me if any issues pop up.
