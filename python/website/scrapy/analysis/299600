desc_long							评测						“Dragon Fin Soup uses an adult oriented, light-hearted tone to disguise some brutally hard gameplay. One that I believe will turn out to be incredibly rewarding.”Hardcore Gamer“...there's an old-school zelda vibe crossed with tactical combat and crafting. That appeals.”Rock Paper Shotgun“There's just something about a drunken badass Red Riding Hood-esque character that's particularly amusing to me, and I'm eager to see what exactly the highly irreverent team has come up with. Given that there was at least one scene in a rustic strip club, with a pole-dancing skeleton, it stands to reason that there will be a lot to enjoy in the rest of the narrative.”The Escapist												关于这款游戏							Dragon Fin Soup seamlessly blends genres to create a fresh experience: half story-driven tactical RPG and half high-stakes roguelike, with a pinch of crass humor and a heaping helping of murder & madness set in a procedurally generated fantasy world.Meet Red Robin - a charming, yet raging alcoholic bounty hunter, who’d rather get into a bar fight than deliver baked goods.
