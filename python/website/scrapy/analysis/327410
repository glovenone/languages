It is a standalone narrative, with its own beginning and ending. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------A word of caution from the devs: This is a rather polarizing game, particularly for fans of To the Moon. As a guarantee with all games from Freebird, there is a 100% personal (confidential) refund policy with no questions asked; even if it just isn't your cup of tea. Details here.--------------------------------------------------------------------------- Key FeaturesA story-driven experience with no dialoguesA mix between adventure game elements and classic RPG aestheticsAn original soundtrack tailored to the narrativeAn espresso execution with no time drains
