I can't wait.”http://indiegames.com/2013/01/cognition_an_erica_reed_thrill.html“It is soaked with gloomy style, is gorgeous to look at and listen to, sets up its plot points with great precision, and  takes off in the third act as it builds to a huge climax with a disquieting final shot that makes me genuinely eager to  play the second episode.”3.5/5 – Adventure Gamers“An exciting story, an interesting main character, challenging puzzles, and a grandiose. atmosphere make for me this first episode a worthy spiritual successor of the Gabriel Knight series, which hopefully will be even better with each new episode. Besides The Walking Dead is the best for me so far (serious) Adventure game experience of the year.”85% – Adventure-Treff													Season One									Order the Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller - Season One to get all four episodes (The Hangman, The Wise Monkey, The Oracle, and The Cain Killer), plus the prequel e-comic, Provenance!
