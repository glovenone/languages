desc_long							评测						“The Beginner's Guide is one of the most daring and creative commercial games to come out in a good long while...a masterclass in character-driven storytelling.”Eurogamer“Few game developers have ever ventured such an open-hearted project about human frailty – and knocked it out of orbit.”The Washington Post“I've been thinking about this game a lot for the past 36 hours. It demanded I think about it, at first only superficially, but later more substantively. I mulled over a lot of questions when I should have been sleeping. I continued thinking right when I woke up. I think I dreamed about it in between.”Destructoid												关于这款游戏							The Beginner's Guide is a narrative video game from Davey Wreden, the creator of The Stanley Parable. It lasts about an hour and a half and has no traditional mechanics, no goals or objectives. Instead, it tells the story of a person struggling to deal with something they do not understand.
