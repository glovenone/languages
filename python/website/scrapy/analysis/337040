A fresh, dark and compelling squad strategy affair that draws on roguelikes as much as it does ALIENS, Screwfly Studios’ science-fiction survival follow-up to Zafehouse Diaries is far and away the most exciting thing I’ve played in 2014.”10 – Coffee Break Gaming“Screwfly Studios has created something that is at once easy to pick up and play yet also full of so many different options that you may find yourself, like me, absolutely fascinated with all of possibilities the game contains.”Destructoid“On one level, yes, Deadnaut captures the feeling of Dallas, Kane and Lambert exploring the Derelict on LV-426. You're cocooned somewhere safe, relaying orders and watching their life signs tremble and shift toward flatline. On another level, Deadnaut is Viscera Cleanup Detail played straight. It's a game about the aftermath of terrible events, but here the aftermath has teeth and claws of its own.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun												关于这款游戏							Deadnaut is Screwfly Studios' second game and follow up to cult hit, Zafehouse: Diaries.Deadnauts, so named because they’re unlikely to return, must explore, investigate and fight their way through the derelict ships of dead civilisations. Every mission is unique and no two locations are the same. Each ship contains mysterious enemies and hostile security systems. Manage your Deadnauts' skills, talents, relationships and flaws - and you might get them out alive.Features Squad-based tactics: Control five complex characters as they explore, investigate and fight their way through each mission Character generation: Create back stories for your team, mould their relationships and equip them well Every game is unique: Dynamically-generated missions and campaigns ensure no two mysteries are the same Flexible and complex: Adapt to your situation with an arsenal of weapons and shields, or use stealth, hacking and sensors to move unnoticed Out of control: Deadnauts have their own fears, motivations and dispositions. Stay in charge, keep in contact, don’t let them out of your sightThere are many ways to play Deadnaut. You can focus on combat and offense with a heavily-armed crew, or go quietly with sensors, cloaks and shields. Use randomly generated Deadnauts, or fine-tune your crew with the character generator. It’s your call.Deadnaut is a challenging game. Not all strategies will work all the time. Instead, you'll need to equip your squad with the right tools, maximise your Deadnauts' respective talents, and adjust your approach when things go wrong.About Screwfly StudiosWe're a two-man developer based in Australia, dedicated to creating deep, innovative strategy games for PC.
