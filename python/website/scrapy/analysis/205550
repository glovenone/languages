desc_long									Now With Zombie Mode:									After having a fun and merry undescribed time in the woods, the legionnaires need a Helicopter ride home. They discover a creepy cabin in the woods(TM) and decide to call a helicopter. Whilst summoning the helicopter, they accidentally summoned the evil forces of hell as well! Fend of hordes of zombies while keeping the generator running, powering the lights and the signal to the helicopter. It wouldn't be a FL map without our signature humour so expect some unusual zombies, crazy environments, a ton of destructables, easter eggs and buckets of GORE. Who can get the highest body count? 																						关于这款游戏							Foreign Legion: Multi Massacre is the (far too) long awaited follow up to Buckets of Blood. Now you can continue the cartoon-style third person battle online and battle your friends, enemies or even frenemies across 6 maps and various modes.
