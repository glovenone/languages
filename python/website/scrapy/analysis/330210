Near-space vessels, heavy industry on the moon and thriving colonies on Mars extend humanity's empire into the great blackness of space. With the earth's mines nearly spent, industrialists rely on the wealth of the heavens. Our solar system's massive Asteroid Belt is a mother lode of resources, just waiting to be torn free and shipped home. "The Belt" is the humanity's newest frontier, as wild and untamed as any that man has faced. Ambitious prospectors blast off  with little more than an Outpost Module and a Mining Tool, to tear the hide off these asteroids and find their fortunes. This bonanza doesn't come without risks. Mere survival is a daily struggle.  Asteroid storms bombard the surface, destroying Outposts, and hostile claim jumpers can appear at any moment.For the brave, there is a fortune to be made.  For the foolish - there is only death. Welcome to the new Gold Rush.Search, Scavenge, and Build:  Mine rare minerals from fallen asteroids and scavenge abandoned outposts to craft and upgrade your technologies.Defend and Upgrade Your Base:  Build a highly customized base with a huge range of functional components. Get The Right Suit: Armor up in a hi-tech industrial space suit that allows miners to explore a vast area of their inhospitable environment.  The Vehicle:  Roam and scavenge the asteroid in an upgradable  rover, equipped with survival systems including oxygen, energy, and cargo space.Tools and Weapons:  Powerful mining equipment can rip the raw ore from fallen asteroids, and can also be used for self-defense against rival miners and claim jumpers.Maintain Life Support:  Survival itself is a challenge in this hostile environment – manage your oxygen, and energy levels to survive.Vast Terrain: Explore an enormous asteroid to discover rare resources, rival miners, abandoned camps and more.Defend Against Asteroids: Life in the belt is dangerous, miners must craft powerful turrets to shoot down incoming asteroids.   Accurate shooting will yield more lucrative ore.Interact with other Players:  Work with and against other players to protect your home territory and collect more resources. Trade, team up and fight in a struggle to establish dominance.
