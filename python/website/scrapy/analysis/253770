Enjoy the realistic AI of both, pedestrians and traffic, which will also influence your own behavior while driving. Interaction with your passengers is also an important facet of your job: It is up to you to decide which ticket to sell and how to greet your customers – they will react accordingly!Thanks to TML’s fantastic ability to recreate buses and other vehicles in great detail, you will find this game to be a truly challenging bus-simulation.
