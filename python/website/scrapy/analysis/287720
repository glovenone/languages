The Supernatural.  The Skeptical.  All are touched upon in Nostradamus: The Last Prophecy.  The player is immortalized as a profiler of sorts in this treasure hunt game - a brilliantly vivid historical rendition of the acclaimed quatrains of Nostradamus. The adventure begins in the South of France as Salon-de-Provence, and its Royal Family fall prey to unfathomable terrors.  You play as Madeleine de Nostradame, the daughter of the famous astrologer, author and apothecary as she hunts down an assassin who uses astrology to disguise his crimes as fearsome prophecies.  But when past, present and the uncertain future collide…your more logical nature may turn superstitious.
