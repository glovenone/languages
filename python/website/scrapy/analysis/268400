The game is very polished and stable. It is fun to play. 90% - PelipPlaneeta.net ...nothing short of brilliant. 9/10 - RTSguru This was seriously one of the best games that we have ever played. If you do not pick this up, you are missing out. 9/10 - Onet.pl If one asked how would Panzer General be like if it was released today? The answer is simple - it would be Panzer Corps. 9/10 - EntDepot Panzer Corps has me dreaming in hexagons nowadays.
