Your only barrier being your ability to defeat the level of monsters in that area, or rather your desire to keep yourself in safer combat zones.”4/5 – RPG Watch“Those who enjoyed the openness of the first two Fallout games will feel right at home in the Staglands.”8.0 – Nichegamer“Serpent in the Staglands is a little gem and a great new entrance to the old school RPG renaissance.

A campaign within the world of Vol, a fully realized setting inspired by the late bronze age in a Transylvanian landscape, with unique politics, races and gods steeped in history. Featuring a chosen party of five, you role-play Necholai, a minor god of a celestial body who descends to the Staglands for a moonlit festival only to find the way home blocked and immortality slipping away. Seeking answers and aid, you take on a mortal body and the guise of a traveling Spicer. This isn't a story of good and evil, saving the world or being a hero, it's about intrigue and your adventure of survival in a harsh land.While the game rolls the dice for you, you'll traverse the Staglands on a path narrated by your own wits and choices.
