This is the first one of its kind to use 3 dimensions that I know of for movement and placement, and it works and functions very well. In fact this is the only true 3d strategy space game that I can think of since Homeworld movement-wise.""The details are great, especially with the battle. Keep up the good work!""I ABSOLUTELY LOVE that I can ram, and/or fire upon my fellow ship(s) if I am not careful.""The concept of the game is great.""Saw you guys at PAX and played on the Android build. Lots of cool details and a great simulation of 3D space combat."
