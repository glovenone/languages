However disaster struck, on finishing the development, Chuck found the trademark had been sold and the new owners wanted him to fund the publishing. Having just spent two years working on Chip’s Challenge 2, Chuck couldn’t afford this so with colossal personal sadness Chip’s Challenge 2 wasn’t released. Twenty-five years later with fans pleading with Chuck to release Chip’s Challenge 2 and nearly five years of negotiation with the trademark owners, Chip’s Challenge 2 can now finally be released in all its original glory with every unseen level and game element.																						关于这款游戏							When we last left our hero 25 years ago, Chip McCallahan had won the heart of Melinda the Mental Marvel and they were celebrating together at the Bit Busters annual eprom.Now a new challenge has been issued by the International Brain Game Club.
