Keeping you going while all this is happening is an awesome 8-bit score rife with neat sound effects and an overall eerie tone.”COG Connected“Main character Clea is a mathematician – she’s not your typical muscle-bound video game hero. Instead of the use of crazy combat skills or weaponry, Turnover instead focuses on using your cunning and wit to survive. There’s a heavy emphasis on stealth, so you’ll need to put a lot of thought into each action you take.”Use A Potion!												关于这款游戏							Features29 levels of challenging stealth gameplay for Windows, Linux, & OS X.Use cover, remain silent, and stay alert to avoid enemies.
