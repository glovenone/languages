desc_long							评测						“[For an interactive text adventure, This Book Is A Dungeon succeeds very well and makes us feel as though we are in the story, immersing us in its fear and horror.]”IGN Greece“Nathan Meunier has created a dungeon crawler horror game filled with HP Lovecraft-inspired monsters and puzzles…[TBIAD] also creates detailed, horrific scenarios, both physically and mentally.”Indie Game Magazine“Surprisingly cohesive, and striking in its resemblance to older Dungeons and Dragons campaigns, albeit with a fairly thick Lovecraftian polish. It captures a desperate tone by offering numerous ways to die. It’s charming, occasionally trippy, and gruesome throughout.”Paste Magazine												关于这款游戏							Auto-cannibalism. Demonic Seduction. Occult Rituals. Bloodfeasting Worms. This Book Is A Dungeon has it all and more. This dark, horrific Twine-based dungeon crawler pairs edgy interactive fiction with grisly pixel art and light RPG elements. Prepare to be disturbed, titillated, and savaged by unholy denizens aplenty in your quest to navigate this sprawling narrative-driven labyrinth bristling with otherworldly doom.WARNING: THIS GAME WILL KILL YOU. OFTEN.Part of the intended challenge is in experimenting to see where different paths and choices lead you. It's impossible to experience all of the content in a single runthrough. Experiment, be bold, and uncover your fate, wherever it may lead!Features: Experience a grim story-driven horror adventure  Solve cryptic and disturbing puzzles  Die in dozens of horrible ways Enjoy light RPG elements, including combat and inventory  Discover multiple endings  BONUS: 40,000 word game dev diary This game is not for the squeamish or faint of heart.
