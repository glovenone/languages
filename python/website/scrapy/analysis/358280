desc_short	-----								Starring hero "Halloween Harry", Alien Carnage is an impressive game with no detail overlooked. Professional musical soundtrack, brilliant full-VGA graphics, non-stop animation and huge start-game and end-game cinematics. If Duke Nukem has a twin separated at birth, it's got to be Halloween Harry!
