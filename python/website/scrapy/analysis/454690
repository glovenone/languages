The branches of the story give you a lot to chew on, but most threads are never tied up. Give it a try if you enjoy open-ended stories that leave you pondering.”Good – Gaming Trend“J’aime les livres interactifs. J’adore les histoires de science-fiction. J’aime beaucoup quand l’histoire semble complètement illogique car c’est un défi de comprendre le cheminement qu’a emprunté l’auteur en rédigeant son livre. Donc, je dis « oui » à Cyber City 2157. Ce jeu correspond à ce qu’on attend d’un jeu indépendant, surprendre !”http://www.graal.fr/2016/05/26/test-cyber-city-2157-la-version-pour-steam/“Cyber City 2157 is a game that showed the theme of postmodernism in the year of 2157. The story content contains multiple parts of space adventure and future city discovering. The special renders made the whole game unique. To consider these three parts, Cyber City 2157 is a new kind of game art, and also as the cultural importance that Cyber City 2157 brings us.”21st Century Digital Art												关于这款游戏							You wake up looking at the cell and trying to remember a dream you have seen last night. There are only vague memories in your head - It was something connected with the cosmos and with the frightened astronaut's face. You have no time to think - you have to go to the work. There you create a perfect simulations of a human, called Molds. So your journey through the parks, cemeteries, suburbs and dreams begins. Your adventure is in the City where the sun never sets. It's a surreal mix of classical visual novels, odd choices, cyberpunk, mysticism and everyday life of a man lost in a rapidly changing reality. You'll see the game, inspired by the numerous arthouse films, postmodern literature and dreams that come closer to dawn. This game is the memory of the games that have never existed.Features:  150 background images, some of them are animated, made in the old-school pixel art  Graphics, based on a simulation of the old systems and monitors (mostly on the Commodore 64 and MSX)  Dive into the crazy world full of mysticism and cyberpunk  The atmospheric and varied music (40 songs)  The total duration of the game: more than 4 hours  Just read, watch, listen to and ponder the riddles of the game world  Steam Trading Cards Thank you and happy reading!
