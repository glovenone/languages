Underneath its simple surface there is a second, and then a third layer of gameplay that leaves you feeling satisfied.”WINDOWS FOREST“'A limited selection of resources' and 'a relaxed rate of growth' are the two main components of this game's design. It's easy to pick up, and with its gratifying sound effects it lends itself to short bursts of play; for 5, 10... 15 minutes...”Mogura Games“It has similar charm to it, though, and is perhaps more appealing to me than most clickers because delving into dungeons over and over again is so much of my game playing history.”IndieGames．com												关于这款游戏							Can you make it to the lowest level of the dungeon?A magical potion store stands alone in a forest on the outskirts of town. Its shopkeeper - the self proclaimed "Witchling" Pastel - murmured to herself one day: "Arrgh I can't be bothered with stocking up on ingredients all the time! Can't somebody else do it for me?!" A shady-looking customer had overheard her: "So you wish to be able to easily stock up on potion ingredients, eh?" The following morning, inside the shop was a mysterious underground dungeon, filled with organic matter. Pastel was furious that someone had dug a dungeon in the shop without her permission! So she prepared herself to make an underground investigation...Create potions and power up!!Exploration and battles are all automated! You just need to focus on powering up Pastel! A simple, yet intuitive game system.A game that feels good to play! Exciting music and effects.A delightful story with distinctive characters.Includes a HARD mode! Try not to lose...
