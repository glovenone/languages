Come hang out to watch solo developer Wase Qazi code new updates and animate new skins and characters live Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 2pm EST.Anara - Princess of the SinOnce the heir to the throne of Kalraan, Anara was driven out of her home as a child when the kingdom, and her parents were taken from her. Growing up in the harsh deserts of Araak, Anara has since become known as one of the world's deadliest assassins. She hunts for the treasure that will finally help her reclaim the land that was taken from her.Dodge Ability When dodging, Anara will disappear and only reappear once she has reached the end of her dodge, making her movements extremely unpredictable.Fin - The Storm EaterKnown better as "Fin, The Storm Eater", Fin's  reputation of being a merciless sky pirate is known around the world. He wanders the skies in search of the fabled Ghost Ship and its secrets of immortality.Dodge Ability When dodging on the ground Fin will dive beneath the earth, with the ability to change direction and end his dodge at will. While powerful on the ground, Fin can only dodge a short distance in the air.Runa - The Frost SlayerAt the age of four Runa was known to wrestle with mountain lions in the great sky mountains of the Viking clans. After the great serpent Midgard destroyed the Viking capital of Frostgaurd, Runa took it upon herself to search for the treasure that could defeat the serpent and avenge the family she lost.Dodge Ability Runa can dodge roll evenly on ground and in air, with no stun delay, giving her the ability to immediately strike after dodging.Jade - Last of the SabreJade grew up with nothing in the streets of XianYu, where she promised herself that since the world gave her nothing, she would take everything it has to offer. As soon as she was old enough (or so the captain believed) Jade joined a crew to take to the skies and seek out the world's greatest treasures. Now she's wanted in over 20 countries with a bounty of over ten thousand gold pieces.Dodge Ability With a lightning fast dodge both on the ground and in the air, Jade will do a quick strafe and change direction as soon as her dodge ends to surprise her enemies from behind.Grimlock - The Crab CaptainGrimlock’s past is mostly a mystery. What little is known about him is that he is Captain of the ship Scythe, serving the Skull Queen by collecting souls for her undead army. Some say that he sold his soul to the Queen in an effort to win her love and that is why he is bound to the Scythe. He is merciless, fearless, and has a thirst for human and sabre flesh. He hates fish though. He rules the sea with his claw-like Skyhook, seeking out new souls for the army of the damned.Dodge Ability Grimlock tucks into his hermit shell, deflecting any hooks and melee attacks that may come his way. If you're trying to attack a hooked Grimlock you'll find yourself pretty vulnerable when your hook gets knocked away!Is there controller support?Yes, Skyhook has full controller support, and is compatible with most standard gamepads including Xbox and Playstation controllers.Will there be online multiplayer?The game is currently local co-op only, and can be played single player against AI. There are currently no plans to add online multiplayer.How big is the development team?The game is made mostly by one person, Wase Qazi, who handles all the design, pixel art, and programming. Julian Shanahan is responsible for the music and Katherine Murray is responsible for the illustrations.Will the game support other languages?I'd love to support more languages. Let me know in the Discussion boards which languages you'd like to see!
