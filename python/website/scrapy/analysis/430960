Emotionless husks of metal have become a part of human society, much to the dismay of the boy. The robot he found at the dumpsite though, this one was different. It laughed, it cried, it smiled, it has dreams, just like a human…Lucy The eternity she wished for is a Visual Novel, about a boy and an android. You play as the boy, who faces decisions and moral dilemmas in this near-future world. This is a story that has touched many hearts and continues to have a strong impact on those who partake in this compelling journey.'About Developers:Scenario : S.RCharacter CG / UI Design : DefenderIf you have any question or request regarding our product, please contact at mvizlab@gmail.com :)
