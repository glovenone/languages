desc_long							评测						“While Retention doesn't last long it is a worthwhile experience, and you'll need to play through three times to see all the photographs. I found it to be intriguing and engaging during my short time with it.”Gamerscape“Retention is the only game I have ever seen try to create an experience consisting only of photos, it does so remarkably well, and creates an interesting game out of it.”IndieBase“Retention is a stylish staging of hundreds of photos, turning the collection into a character building exercise somewhere between “Memento” and “Choose Your Own Adventure” titles. Can a man be truly defined by frozen moments of his history? Is identity really just a question of perspective?”Indie Game Reviewer													Don't miss our new games!									http://store.steampowered.com/app/448470/http://store.steampowered.com/app/415960/																						关于这款游戏							This game is about a person who kept running through his life, never looking back at the past.
