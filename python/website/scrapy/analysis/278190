Royalty-free and easy to use, you’ll be amazed by how fast you can create and deliver your own great-sounding original tracks – no previous music production experience required!Your Steam Powered ACID Music Studio content package will put you on the fast track to making great music. In addition, it serves a couple of other purposes: it provides the perfect gateway to the Sony Sound Series collection of loop library titles, and it also delivers some specialized tools and sounds that you’ll be able to put to use when you’re ready to dive into the world of virtual instruments and custom sound sets.The content package includes three major items:1.	Loops and Songs. This is a Sony Sound Series ‘construction kit’ type loop library. Here you’ll find all the different kinds of sounds that you need to create complete pieces of music right out of the gate. Sound Series titles comprise ‘construction kits’, ‘single instrument libraries’, and more. Construction kits contain the sounds of all kinds of instruments, and are designed to be one-stop shops for making complete tracks. Single instrument libraries are just that: giant collections that focus on one instrument (like guitar or synth or sax, etc.) or one type of instrument (such as drums and percussion). The Sound Series contains yet another type of highly specialized library, called ‘Artist Integrated’. This type of library is a Sony exclusive that offers extraordinary potential for creating amazing music. Visit http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/loops/artistintegrated for more information about how Artist Integrated titles work.2.	ACID Music Studio 10 Content. This is your gateway to the Sound Series catalog. Here, the loops are named after the Sound Series titles that they come from. When you hit on some sounds that you really like, get the names of the loop library titles from the loops’ filenames and then head over to http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/loops where you can easily explore the associated titles. This is one of the best ways that we can think of to find all the titles that will work best for you.3.	Custom Sound Sets and Songs. When you’re ready to go deeper, try these DLS instruments. This collection of 90 unique virtual instruments opens doors in ACID that will take your music to the next level. 26 ACID projects that use the instruments will show you what’s possible – the rest is up to you! The combined power of ACIDized loops and DLS virtual instruments, running in your Steam Powered ACID Music Studio, is a truly mind-blowing experience, as you will soon discover. Like all the best games, learning how to do it is easy, but total mastery is a never-ending and totally immersive process.All three content categories contain actual ACID projects that use the loops and sounds provided in your Steam Powered ACID Music Studio content package. These projects are yours to use in any way you like, even as-is. Use them as-is to score your videos, sing and rhyme over – whatever suits you! Try using them as song starters and for inspiration. Even if you never use them for your own projects, they’re a lot of fun to listen to. Along the way, you’ll begin to get an appreciation for how our sounds work together effortlessly in ACID, flexing and adapting automatically to create beautiful, startling, and very often crazy combinations. You’ll also discover what’s available in the immense Sound Series catalog. Explore and enjoy!
