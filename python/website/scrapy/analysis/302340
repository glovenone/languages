desc_long							评测						“Martian Memorandum has more in common with Mean Streets than with the later FMV titles, but does fit into the Tex-a-verse nicely. It's a fitting sequel that improves and streamlines some of the flaws from the original, while offering a new case and vastly different locales. If you're coming from the series backwards, you might not be as impressed with this title as you will be with Under A Killing Moon, but it's still worth a play if you want another chance to slip into Tex's gumshoes.”81 – Just Games Retro“The second installment in the Tex Murphy series, this sequel to the original Mean Streets was quite fun; almost as fun as the original. Popular characters were met once again, along with a short video animation of each character when you first meet (for a game on mere floppy disks, this was pretty impressive!).”80 – Techtite												关于这款游戏							Experience the power of full motion video and sound!An exhilarating fast paced interactive mystery Guaranteed to Entertain You!The FIRST EVER Multimedia Entertainment ProductOVER 24 MEG. of Sound and Graphics Excitement compressed to just over 7 Meg.Fully Animated TALKING CharactersINTRIGUING Story LineIN DEPTH Character DevelopmentOn Demand HINT SCREENSRich MUSICAL SCORE - Digitized Sound EffectsSupports ALL Major Sound BoardsThe Most Vivid, LIFELIKE GRAPHICS Ever SeenA Humorous, Thrilling Adventure With A KNOCKOUT ENDING!
