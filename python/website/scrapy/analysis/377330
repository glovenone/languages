Looking at screenshots for Close Your Eyes had me thinking it would be silly and ineffective, but through perfect use of unnerving sound and some twisted, surprising visuals, it easily left me frightened, unsure whether I should be playing it at night.”Indiegames Blog“More than startle, the game bothers me. The simple graphics and minimalist design (...) create a very oppressive atmosphere. The sound of the game is also quite bizarre, contributing to the immersion in the oddities of the universe proposed on the screen.”Update Or Die												关于这款游戏							Welcome, Ladies & Gentlemen!A-ha, how y'all doing?
