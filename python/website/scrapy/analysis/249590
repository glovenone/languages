Awesome mix of classical orchestra, with a touch of Russian inspiration and a myriad of metal bits and electrical stuff.Teslagrad is available for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux."It's beautiful minimalist storytelling, and it fits really well with the gameplay proper, which is delightful in more ways than one."
