The dialogue could have used another pass through the typewriter, and the acting is strictly amateur. Noctropolis is a solid adventure set in an intriguing and visually stunning world.”82 – PC gamer“Despite all of its shortcomings, Noctropolis is a fun and engaging game. It has a campy, tongue-in-cheek humor and never takes itself too seriously.”80 – Four Fat Chicks												关于这款游戏							In a world where comic books are real - The final issue is Evil!In the City Of Darkness, where the spirit of the times is an insatiable lust for flesh and blood, a hero stands alone.
