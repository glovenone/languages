Great and terrible mysteries and even greater treasures await if you are bold or foolhardy enough to go beyond the beyond.The Bizarre World of DeathstateIn Deathstate, you are a traveller of the outer realms. You have discovered the secrets of deep astral projection by entering into a fully death-like meditative state. While in your Deathstate, you can go beyond the beyond to realms previously only imagined by those enlightened or mad enough to dwell upon them. Tread lightly though, for these far planes of demi-existence that you choose to explore are extremely hostile to mortal souls.GAME FEATURESExplore a Unique Take on Classic 16-bit WorldDeathstate features a unique combination of retro 16-bit visuals and advanced Unity shader effects.

Being a procedural bullet-hell, it’s up to player knowledge and skill to survive emergent dangers in gameplay.Unlock Multiple Player Characters with Unique AbilitiesOver repeat runs, players will unlock new characters with unique abilities.

New player characters will enable players to customize their starting build, increasing their chances of surviving the horrors that lie beyond.Discover Mystic Tomes, Ritual Blades, Relics, and OrgansThe treasure you discover in Deathstate pushes the limits on cool and bizarre game loot.
