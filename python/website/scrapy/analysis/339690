desc_long							评测						“You’ll have a blast with friends as you scream, laugh, and try to stop each other from winning.”8 – The Sixth Axis“At the modest price point of only ten dollars, Paperbound is a steal. It’s got enough content to keep you and your friends entertained for hours.”9 – Game Scouts“The action is an explosive brawl of clinking blades, sailing ink bombs, and raucous laughter.”7 – GameSpot													Controller Strongly Recommended									Microsoft Xbox Controller for Windows® (or equivalent XInput-compatible controller) is strongly recommended.																						关于这款游戏							'We're gonna make this an office staple." -Gamespot"It’s a gorgeous and fast-paced game" - Rock, Paper, ShotgunPaperbound is a smash-up brawler that combines platforming, twitchy combat, and gravity redirection. Run with scissors, walk on walls, and lob ink bombs in whimsical-yet-intense battles within the pages of old books. In addition to the 360 degrees of gravitational freedom, several other twists add to the tension and drama of a match, such as the "escape through the page tear" victory mechanic which brings a second phase to the combat and causes players to momentarily team up with their adversaries. Using a gamepad is highly recommended in this local-multiplayer party game.Play as one of Paperbound's 11 original characters or as characters from Guacamelee, Monaco, VVVVVV, Cards and Castles, and Tumblestone.When your friends aren't around, Paperbound features challenging AI bots. Each character has his or her own personality. Some are aggressive, some are more cautious. Some are even vindictive. Some make adept use of all weapons, while others prefer to get in close for melee combat. The bots are great for solo players, for when you want to even out the teams, or for when you simply want some extra chaos.Battle within the pages of old classics including…A Journey to the Center of the EarthSkull KingdomA Book of Five RingsThe Book of the DeadDante's InfernoCompete in team or solo battles in a variety of game modes that will keep you laughing and screaming for hours:Classic VersusCapture the QuillLast Man StandingLong Live the KingPaperbound. Smashy, smashy fun for up to four friends in the same room.Using a gamepad is highly recommended. Keyboard is not ideal.Note: Paperbound does NOT support online multiplayer. It supports local multiplayer by connecting multiple controllers to your PC, so invite your friends over, plug in some controllers, and have a great time. Currently, only Xbox 360/One controllers are officially supported. PlayStation 4 controllers have been confirmed to work using DS4 Tool. Other controllers may work using XInput wrappers, but compatibility is not guaranteed.
