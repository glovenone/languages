What the hell is going on?”Polygon“#SelfieTennis takes the three basic elements of tennis—the ball, the racket, the people—and invites you to do whatever the heck you want with them. Without the rules of the physical court, that club in your hand becomes a far more versatile and potentially violent device.”Killscreen“You can try to play a proper match, get a nice volley going with yourself, or just smash the ball into the strange spectators with tennis ball heads and watch them flop lifelessly to the ground.”Gamasutra												关于这款游戏							Instructions: You use the triggers to spawn the ball(s) and racket. Double-click on racket trigger to lock it. You can change controller hands on the small button above the touchpad. Knock #BallPeople off the court and take their hearts to enter #HeartAttack mode (time-limited upgrades). #SelfieStick is on ball controller's grips and you can record a GIF and tweet it out via the touchpad - log on to your Twitter profile via the computer screen when you start the game. Double-click grips to lock it in your hand. SAFETY IS KING: Controllers can fly, SO WEAR WRIST STRAPS! Cheats (on keyboard):- I: spawn peeps outside court - O: delete peeps outside court - P: spawn peeps inside court - L: delete peeps inside court - B: for high Balls serve mode - E: for Enio ball (experimental - for higher visibility)- K: for Kids mode (don't cheat, if you're an adult...by age) - S: deactivate the #SelfieStick - M: turn of Music - Arrow keys: rotate play space - HAHAHA: Laugh at your friends for extra hearts!Us VRUnicorns are hardcore jammers and we're constantly jamming on new and fun features for #SelfieTennis.
