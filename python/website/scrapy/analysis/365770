Its beauty, wit and intelligence are nicely offset by its quiet anger.”9/10 – Polygon“Volume’s story levels are designed with the same care that players must use when playing, and I enjoyed the experience from start to finish. With true stealth games a rare breed today, Volume stands as a declaration that the formula can still work.”88/100 – Game Informer“The atmosphere, voice acting and plot had me coming back for more even when the puzzles overwhelmed me.”5/5 – The Guardian												关于这款游戏							WELCOME, TO THE VOLUMEA hundred levels lie ahead, but that's only the beginning of your adventure in the Volume.
