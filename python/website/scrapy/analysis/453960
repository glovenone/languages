desc_long								关于这款游戏							Envy the Dead is zombie survival roguelike, where you are leading group of unique, randomly generated characters through destroyed lands, infested with zombies. The game combines node-based exploration with random events, similar to games like FTL or Renowned Explorers with Tower Defense based battle mechanics. The characters are all randomly generated and they are all have different personalities, skills and traits. The game is extremely hardcore. Your characters can be injured, infected, killed in battles or in accident. Your supplies of food and medicine are limited, and someone in your group will have to starve so all your group can survive. During your travel, you can encounter hundreds of different events, in which you can find supplies, fight zombies or meet another survivors. Some events could require hard decisions with life and death consequences. For example: someone in your group was captured by bandits, and you must choose between leaving him to die, risking the whole group and getting him out or trying to trade him for some of your supplies. Battles are based on tower defense mechanics. You must destroy waves of enemies or you can win some time and then run from them. You must take into account skills of your characters.
