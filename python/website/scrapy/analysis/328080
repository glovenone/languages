desc_long								关于这款游戏							Get Involved in DevelopmentFollow @RaymondDoerr on TwitterGame ConceptRetro-Pixel Castles is at heart a godlike village simulator, but it also throws in plenty of familiar game play mechanics from classic 90s era real-time strategy games like Warcraft, along with some tower defense and survival elements in an attempt to create a new kind of village simulator. The goal is to try to bridge the gap between the depth and complexity of traditional village simulators, the fun of godlikes and the simplicity of real-time strategy.Key FeaturesYou can't win!The problem nearly all village simulators tend to face is you seem to eventually reach a point where you can't lose the game. You become so skilled at knowing exactly what to do and in exactly what order, the game loses all of it's appeal and you eventually run off to play something else. That's not the case with Retro-Pixel Castles, it aims to make a game you can't win. Every game day, the game gets progressively harder. In RPC you will eventually lose. The goal isn't to win, that's not possible, the goal is to see how long you can survive! Build a village, and die trying!A major part of the game is village management, and trying to discover new and creative ways to use the tools at your disposal to keep yourself alive as long as possible. Several Game ModesCurrently, the game offers two main game modes. Survival and Peaceful, Survival is the game the way it was meant to be played, as a brutal survival style village sim. Peaceful on the other hand has nearly no monsters, and plays out much like a traditional village simulator with some godlike and RTS elements sprinkled on top. More game modes are planned like the upcoming Sandbox mode where you basically are given unlimited resources and access to play around with the engine.Godlike ElementsNot only can you manage your village, but you also have many godlike abilities at your disposal. You can alter the terrain, blast enemies from afar, heal your villagers and speed up resource growth. Unlock Content Through Gameplay (Coming soon!)In RPC, you will find yourself in a harsh and unforgiving environment, constantly trying to find new ways to keep your little villagers alive for just a few more days. As you play, you'll unlock more content, like additional buildings, items and units you can use in your next attempt to see if you can survive even longer than the last!Even though you can't beat this game, you most certainly can make progress in it! Every round you play you'll gain experience, unlocks, and other interesting goodies that will expand the game.Tons of map set themes!Every set of maps will follow a certain theme (Forest, Desert, Underground, etc). Most of the current screenshots only feature a few of these map sets. But many, many more are planned.The Soundtrack!A full original soundtrack, made by Bibiki Garcia that blends orchestral instruments in a way fans of old 1990s era PC gaming will love and remember!DRM-FREESixtyGig Games is a DRM free independent game developer! Retro-Pixel Castles will not now or ever in the future have any sort of DRM! Piracy protection only hurts you guys, the loyal paying players. So you rest assured knowing that once you buy yourself a copy of Retro-Pixel Castles you'll never again have to concern yourself with nagging questions about if you can continue playing the game down the road due to something like always-online logins, lost registration codes or because you bought a new computer and you're only licensed to put the game on one. All I ask from you is to be reasonable and responsible, you can buy the game and play it as much as you like, wherever you like. Just tell your friends to support my DRM-Free philosophy and buy their own copy! Free Content Patches, no paid-DLC100% FREE CONTENT PATCHES/DLC!I don't believe in paying for Downloaded Content. If you buy Retro-Pixel Castles you will have access to the entire game and all the content I'll ever create for this it, forever! I believe DLC is greedy, and you deserve to have the full gaming experience from day 1, right out of the (figurative) box!Have a say!Your feedback is extremely important. You can reply here or head on over to the Official Website and help shape the direction of development! :)
