Step inside the grotesque house of lunatic clowns.You are trapped in a darkened house with lunatic clowns, due to a meaningless reason. You need to find the key to escape the house. Hidden in a random spot. Some of the clowns are evil and they want to kill you. You don’t know which. You have a pistol in your hand, use it to defend yourself. If you kill an innocent clown, you lose the game.Key’s location and the innocence of clowns change each time you start a new game.The game offers a small room and three clowns by far. Wait for Clown House 2 for a big mansion and more clowns!
