desc_long							评测						“what stands out here is that it’s smart. For a first time project, it’s impressively smart. And almost immediately very tricky”Rock, Paper, Shotgun“There is something so lovable about Zeb, not because you know his backstory, because you don’t, not because of his charming words, because he doesn’t speak but because this game invokes the same sense of childish accomplishment and joy that came with a bygone era of games.”Ordinary Gamer“Plazma Being lives up to its core as a Puzzle-Platformer title; as a challenging puzzle game.”GamersFTW												关于这款游戏							Take control of Zeb in this puzzle/platformer.
