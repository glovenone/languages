desc_long								关于这款游戏							Wooden Floor is a first person adventure horror game inside an old house that seems normal but the further you progress into the game you start to realize that rooms change if you close a door behind you and whole corridors appear out of nowhere. Not being able to predict what is going to happen next or where you are heading for you need to make your way through the increasingly maze-like becoming house to find a way out of this bad dream that you just woke up into. The only thing that goes with you is the wooden floor underneath your feet. Gameplay Features: Level Streaming -> changing, appearing/disappearing, rotating rooms, corridors and objects Unreal Engine 3 graphics (UDK) Maze-like becoming house and environment (expanding environment) Puzzle Elements (Keys, Collecting and some Jump 'n' Run or Platforming) Adequate Scares (no screamers)
