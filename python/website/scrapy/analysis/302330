desc_long							评测						“The mystery was amusing, and the game itself was the first ever attempt to incorporate 256 colors into an adventure game (sorry, Sierra). I loved this game!”100 – Techtite“The premise behind Mean Streets is simple. What can be better than a modern sci-fi story like Blade Runner or an old-fashioned Agatha Christy murder mystery? The answer is obvious—the two combined! Take a post nuclear war Earth, a classic detective noir, a mysterious foe, a femme fatale, and an evil plot to destroy mankind; mix the ingredients, stir, and voila, you have a fantastic adventure game called Mean Streets!”80 – Adventure Classic Gaming												关于这款游戏							The year is 2033.
