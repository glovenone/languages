Word of warning: If you are looking for the usual storyline, crowded HOG scenes, Map, journal, standard puzzles and mini-games, sparkles that show you where to go and a hint system that is helpful, this is NOT your game.I loved the story which may seem a bit out there; I loved the graphics and funny enough, I relly did enjoy the Music. This game was one of the most challenging games I had played back when I was a novice to the adventures genre.”5 – Bigfishgames“his game was quite an adventure and I enjoyed every minute! It includes time travel, gathering items, creating potions, puzzles, arcade action, and gorgeous scenery!”5 – Bigfishgames												关于这款游戏							Prepare to go on a fantastic journey which will take you from damp prehistoric forests, to the sultry deserts of ancient Egypt, to dirty Wild West saloons, and luxurious medieval castles! Green Moon is a Hidden Object game like no other, combining science with magic and reality with mysticism. Travel to a unique world full of mystery and exciting opportunities as you learn ancient and timeless secrets!The breath-taking adventures usually start from the little, this time – from an inheritance certificate. Lucky you are, before going to a better world your poor old uncle Louis signed you away his even older house. So, please, receive the photo, take the keys, look round and get settled. But shabby and plain as it is, the mansion still conceals a fabulous mystery. Penetrating into its secret premises you face a magic book which is going to reveal you unbelievable knowledge and provide a good few hours of unforgettable pastime. Features: Stunning visuals Over 300 locations About 50 hours gameplay Great number of mini-games
