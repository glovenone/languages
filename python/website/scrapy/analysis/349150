desc_long								关于这款游戏							"Dead TrailZ captures a slice of the zombie apocalypse beautifully." - Eurogamer "I just like sniping as a game dynamic, and I liked how the game was trying to combine that with tactical placement.” - TechCrunchEscape the Apocalypse. Zipline between vantage points surrounding the battle field and use heavy weapons to cover your teammate on longer and longer supply runs. Basic rules:- Runner starts and ends at the train station- Runner has a certain amount of ammunition which refills for each run- Predict the runner's path and pave the way for him to return safelyThe main game is about scavenging a series of maps, finding enough fuel & weapons in each stage to progress to the next.Your runner finds supplies & fuel in the boxes, which he hands over to you after each run.If things get tight, call the runner back any time.Gather XP with your shooting kills to unlock perma-boosts and make sure to pick up some helicopter drops.The first two maps can also be played in an endless practice scenario & also feature 15 strategic levels, each with a unique solution path that requires more than just shooting. Levels have a fix setup of where survivors come in and where the zombies are and can only be resolved with strategic and well-timed use of the available weapons and tools.
