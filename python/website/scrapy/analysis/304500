It challenges and satisfies in equal quantities, and rarely feels frustrating. Rooms: The Main Building does all of this, and is genuinely addictive as a result.”6/10 – Jamin Smith, VideoGamer												关于这款游戏							Rooms is set in a dark and mysterious house called ‘Rooms Mansion’, the game plunges you into a virtual world based around 100 challenging sliding puzzles with a twist. In each room or level, you must think carefully and strategically navigate your character to the room’s exit by sliding sections of the room, the same way as a slide puzzle. Your character can walk from tile to tile, but remember that only the tile that your character is standing in can be moved. In this parallel world you need to use an amazing array of unusual items and devices, including telephones that teleport you from one side of the room to the other and explosives, to break through brick walls or other obstacles. And watch out – some rooms are filled with water and will need to be pumped out! After escaping each puzzle you will be rewarded with four golden puzzle pieces that are required to secure your way home.The solution is only a doorstep away. Getting there is the easy part.
