Each locale comes with its own set of surprises and driving challenges to master.

This is driving at its most exciting, varied and open. •	NEVER DRIVE ALONEJump in and out seamlessly and build your crew of four through bonding or intense rivalry. Whether your objective is to take down a convoy or to escape the police, achieving it with friends ensures a fresh experience each time you join in.•	A PLAYGROUND OF UNPRECEDENTED SCOPE AND VARIETYThe entire United States is your driving playground – all roads and everything in between. Every type of terrain imaginable is yours to master – from downtown city streets to suburbs, hillsides, cornfields, canyons, desert dunes or even race tracks.•	PREPARE YOUR CAR FOR THE NEXT CHALLENGECollect body and performance parts as you progress to customize and upgrade your licensed cars. Equip your ride with 5 different tuning specs (street, perf, dirt, raid, circuit) to adapt to different driving terrains. Choose from a wide range of perks to enhance your vehicle according to your driving style.•	THE EXPERIENCE GOES ON, WHEREVER YOU AREContinue the experience on iOS, Android tablets, and on the web. Track of your friends’ performance and  fine tune your ride before  taking it live to set new records, or send your crew on jobs while on-the-go to  earn more XP and parts.
