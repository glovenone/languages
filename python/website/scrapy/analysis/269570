desc_long								关于这款软件							In-depth Game Dev Tutorials for Unity 3 & 4If you've been dreaming of making a computer game then you've come to the right place. GTGD S1 is an in-depth set of video tutorials through which you will develop an awesome little multiplayer FPS from scratch, using Unity free. I've designed these tutorials for beginners so you won't be lost. Check out my YouTube channel to see my teaching style. ATTENTION: With the release of Unity 5.1, GTGD S1 is now obsolete, so please don't buy this unless you're really keen to study a piece of history, or support my efforts. I have a new series in development, GTGD S3 and it should be available on Steam February/March 2016. You can watch it as I roll it out on my YouTube channel right now.This package has the added benefit of all video by video project folders to make it easier for you to debug your mistakes and accelerate your learning. You do not have to purchase anything, not even this video tutorial package to study GTGD S1.GTGD S1 was made with Unity 3.4.0 and it works fine in Unity 4 with some minor edits to the code. Video S2.2 explains what bits of code need to be changed.LauncherS1 comes with a fast launcher that gives you quick access to all S1 resources. The launcher will open the video tutorials in your default media player. Videos are in 720p.My Other WorkGTGD S2, the sequel to GTGD S1 is out and I've also released my game, Guild Commander.GTGD S2Guild Commander
