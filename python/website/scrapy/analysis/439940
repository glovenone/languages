You visit an amusement park with a bunch of friends anyway. // 8 DAYS PRIOR. You take a history exam. Maybe you pass, maybe you fail.

This is where the game begins. // THE THING IS: You can choose to fight this outcome. --------ABOUT LUCID9-------- Lucid9 is a visual novel focused on a web of intricate mysteries set in the fictional 2018 metropolis of Isamu.

Every step leads Yama to the most unexpected - and terrifying - culprit…--------DEVELOPERS-------- Lucid9 is being created by Fallen Snow Studios, an international group of visual novel enthusiasts who seek to make a VN by fans for fans. As Lucid9 is a passion project that has been created without any budget so far, we are aiming to release it free of charge in order to both engage established fans of visual novels, as well as introduce newcomers to this unique storytelling medium. We are working our hardest to make sure the rest of the story will be available for free as well.--------UPCOMING-------- Free Voice Acting patch: All of Inciting Incident will be fully voiced in English by Yin Yang Voices. Recording production has already begun, but it's a deliberate and lengthy process. Consequently, we're aiming to release the patch for the voices in 2017. Second arc of Lucid9: We are currently working on the heroine routes, which will comprise the second part of Lucid9. They will be included in a future patch. There isn't any precise release date for this patch, but we will make sure to share progress regularly with all of you.
