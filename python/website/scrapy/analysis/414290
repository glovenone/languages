desc_long							评测						“A fun pixel art roguelike romp, full of charm and character.”Alpha Beta Gamer“PLPA is a very nice game to have if you’re into games that have a classic look and simple but enjoyable mechanics”Softpedia												关于这款游戏							Rescue the King from of a Evil Mage! Get a beautiful Princess’ hand in marriage! Use various equipment and artifacts! Dodge from enemies attack and jump over the spikes! Enjoy pixel retro stylistics! Have you already done this before? Do it again! PLPA is a dynamic platformer with a combo system and special strikes, there is also a bit of rogue-lite genre. The principal aim is to get through all floors of the Dark Tower and outfight the main antagonist a Evil Mage. That’s not easy due to a instant death which is followed by a full castle structure regeneration. First of all, success in the game depends on player’s skills, not on random. The player learns the game mechanics, operation of certain artifacts, items, skills and also behavior of enemies and bosses. The keynote of this gameplay is for a gamer to learn from mistakes and pump his own skills, but not only the protagonist’s ones. -The main thing about the game is having fun! No farming and excessive complexity.A gamer will face lots of fun things, unusual situations, easter eggs and references to other games. Self-irony also takes place. -The total generation of location structure, objects, artifacts, traps, enemies and bosses. -12 characters, different in performance and equipment. -Create equipment and pump it with stones, runes and enchantment. -Hidden features and events. -All of this and much more are seasoned by hurricane-like action with various strikes, skills and spells!
