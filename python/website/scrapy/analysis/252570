This is a game that everyone should try.”9.2/10 – WatchTower Gaming“Like a surreal and low budget horror film discovered on an obscure television channel during a night that has lasted too long, it’s jarring, hugely imperfect and strangely alarming. I’ve happily lost myself in it for two evenings now.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun“The overall design speaks not just to its retro-ish style but also its place among recent horror games. Depths of Fear: Knossos is a fairly small game in scope, simple and focused in a way that big budget, kitchen sink AAA titles are not, and to a large degree that is a relief.”7/10 – Bloody Disgusting												关于这款游戏							Depths of Fear :: Knossos is a Greek-themed 1st person adventure game with stealth, action and edge-of-your-seat elements within rogue-like procedurally generated levels.
