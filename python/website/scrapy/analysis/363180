I would also love to see the Conquer Club maps released in an offline mode physical copy version in the future. I know, I know, I am an endless well of wanting things. I will work on being more content with what I have.”70 – Family Friendly Gaming“It’s the very model of “easy to grasp, difficult to master,” and while it does have obvious limitations in depth, it’s a perfect little quick-match strategy game.”60 – Hardcore Gamer												关于这款游戏							Tenshu General DescriptionTenshu General, is a simple, elegant, Real Time Strategy (RTS) game for those who favor short play sessions over long sessions.
