desc_long								关于这款游戏							When a man has his body stolen he typically has one of two reactions; he either dies, or he sets out on an adventure as a disembodied head, hell-bent on revenge.Amygdala is an action/adventure platformer where every living world you explore is a freshly generated permadeath challenge. There’s no hands and no handholding as you face off against swordheads, voidpigs, giant swarms of beez and the wizard that stole your body (hint: it’s NEVER his final form). Learn and survive. Avoid traps. Watch wildlife get in fights. SHOOT MINDBULLETS. POOP BRICKS. IT NEVER ENDS, IT JUST GETS HARDER.For leaderboards, community videos and game help check out http://Amygdala.MachineSpirit.netProcedurally Generated WorldsAmygdala builds each new world fresh and toasty.
