The game is fun to play, but it was also compelling to watch someone else have a go and see them manipulate and populate the planet.”http://mashable.com/2015/11/01/indie-games-pax-australia/#nGvJcZWmnEqV“The energetic amalgam of MAD sims and arcade-speed action, served on a bed of gorgeous minimalist design, Element's current early access build bodes swimmingly.”http://www.wargamer.com/Article/10319“Rome was built, enjoyed, and decimated in 0.002 of a day. It was great and, even as I was wiped off the face of my earth, it looked lovely.”Rock Paper Shotgun												关于这款游戏							Element is a realtime strategy space game for people who don't have time to play realtime strategy space games. Home no longer provides a means to survive. A fight for resources to escape our system has begun. The future lies beyond… Element is a visually stunning realtime strategy space game with a focus on sharp, accessible gameplay. Element is for lovers of beautifully crafted, original looking games. It is for people who are into space and strategy games but don't have hours of time to invest. It's also for gamers who enjoy launching missiles and blowing things up :) You are escaping a decaying solar system. You must visit each planet, mine enough element, and defeat the enemy to progress to the outer planets and beyond. Generate energy, mine element, build attack and defence units, and destroy the enemy while maintaining a balance between earth, air, water, and fire.Notes:Our preferred control method is currently a game controller. Element supports keyboard, mouse, keyboard and mouse, and a game controller. Community feedback will help us to refine our game controller scheme and device support. Game controllers should be attached before launching the game. Additionally, some game controller device buttons will toggle a free-flying camera mode.The game speed can be adjusted using the -/+ keys while playing to super-slomo and accelerate time. Use '0' to reset to normal speed. The energy button also acts as an in-game pause button.Currently Element starts with a screen settings dialog to select your desired resolution and window mode - in a future update these will become options inside the game. On a Mac these settings can be optionally hidden from the dialog itself. To show them again hold Alt/Option when launching the game via Steam. Big Picture mode is fully supported on Mac when the screen settings dialog is hidden. The game requires a vertical resolution of at least 640px.Linux support for Element Early Access is considered experimental. Community feedback will help us to further refine the system requirements.
