The Allies are about to attack..."D-Day" adds the famous landing on the coast of Normandy by the Allied Forces to the tactical World War II shooter "Iron Front – Liberation 1944". Merciless gun battles for each centimeter of the beaches await brave soldiers on the side of the Allies and the Wehrmacht alike in this extensive expansion. Brutal combat unfolds on the storm-lashed shores of France, as the future of the world is about to be decided at the Atlantic Wall... and you are in the thick of it! Fight with the Allied Forces against the dogged Wehrmacht defenders, or join the battle on the side of Germany and use any means to stop the Allies' advance."D-Day" introduces a whole new scenario with new weapons, military equipment and missions in both single-player and multiplayer modes (incl. co-op), as well as the Allies as a new faction. In the expansion, players can take on the roles of American soldiers, pilots and tank crews to fight for the freedom of France. The famous landing craft which carried the US soldiers to the bloody battle of liberation at Omaha Beach are of course also included in D-Day. Air support is provided by the P-47 Thunderbolt, while Sherman tanks support the advance of the ground forces.Following the successful landing of the Allied Forces, the battles in Normandy continue with new missions featuring authentic re-creations of the military equipment of the age, including the Garand M1 rifle and the Browning automatic rifle. Players can also, for the first time, enter the war on the American side and use the new troops in multiplayer mode as well. However, the German troops are also well-prepared for D-Day: In response to frequent requests from the community, the Tiger I panzer is ready to deploy in the expansion.Note: To install the D-Day 1944 DLC go to "expansions" and click the DLC 1 and choose "install."																						关于这款游戏							欢迎来到前线！波兰，1944年的夏天：红军正准备对纳粹国防军发起猛烈打击——你就置身于这场战斗中。作为一名德国或苏联的前线士兵，你的技能和战术技巧将决定你是否能达到军事目标。指挥你的部队，使用真实的武器和驾驶致命的战机翱翔蓝天。在前所未有的高度模拟中跨越广袤的战场，战争的热浪在单人和多人模式中等待着你。在这里战争展现了它的真实面貌！游戏特色：策略战争模拟：以第一人称扮演士兵和以第三人称扮演指挥官涉及步兵，坦克和战机的大规模战斗指挥部队和载具，掌控所有的载具会让你感觉身临其境两个架空历史的战役丰富的设置选项，从射击到策略真实武器的庞大军械库超过35种载具和战机丰富的多人联线功能，包括合作战役和玩家对战功能强大的编辑器
