Developed to give users the thrill of today's High Tech Radio Controlled Cars, Boats, Planes and Quadcopters on any of the user created track/maps/venues.  Fly some quadcopters armed with paintball guns, Pilot an RC Jet Liner or go on a RC Rubicon with your Rock Crawler.

Keyboard, XBOX360 for PC, PS3, Steam Controllers etc. Though most prefer using a real rc radio via USB-PC (Not available for Linux or Mac as of 7-18-15) adapter. These are readily available for todays real rc transmitters. This is the best way to drive RC SIM 2.0.
