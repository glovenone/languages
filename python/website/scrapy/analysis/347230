A great simulation that both novice and veteran PC pilots can enjoy.”95 – PC Gamer“If you've got a DX2 or better and fancy a fun, but ultimately short lived game that falls halfway between flight sim and blaster, then go for Pacific Strike. For anyone else - real flight sim buffs in particular - 1942: The Pacific Air War is a must.”93 – PC Gamer UK												关于这款游戏							They were desperate, daring and deadly!For the past 50 years, only the courageous veteran pilots of World War II knew the real risks of fighting the legendary Pacific air wars.Now it's your turn!Strap yourself into the cockpit of 1942, The Pacific Air War and you'll experience the ultimate simulation of daring air combat over the South Pacific.
