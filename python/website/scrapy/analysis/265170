At its core, the game can be thought of as a top-down version of Sega’s Virtual On, only with the speed cranked up to the max and cute anime girls in the place of mechs.” … “Beyond its twitch action, what makes SUGURI X so engaging is the depth of its combat.” ... “Bless Rockin’ Android for bringing SUGURI X to the Playstation 3. The game’s potential audience is certainly limited and the frenzied action may be a little too much for most gamers to swallow, but for those of us who live and die by these types of niche titles, SUGURI X is an absolute godsend.”Gamesugar“SUGURI X Edition challenges players to simultaneously implement both fighting game and shoot-’em-up strategies, and the end result is as interesting as it is addictive.” ... “The continuous Arcade mode, local and online versus, techno soundtrack, in-game Youtube recording, and the visible difference in difficulty modes all give SUGURI X Edition the boost it needs, especially for its shockingly low price.”Gamezone“The intense battles and tight gameplay in Acceleration of SUGURI X Edition offer a high replay value. If you spend a little time getting to know this shooter-brawler hybrid, you'll want to dig deeper to check out each character's moves, test her unique combat abilities against other adversaries, and grab a pal to pummel over and over again.”Gamespot												关于这款游戏							In Acceleration of SUGURI X-Edition HD (aka AoSXE HD), the "little war" continues at a breakneck pace.
