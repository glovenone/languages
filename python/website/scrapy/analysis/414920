desc_long							评测						“Each stage is filled with all sorts of creative enemies, but the best part by far are the huge bosses you and your team will defeat. Screen-sized rock monsters, vampires, dragons, and more. Corgi Warlock never fails to surprise you with its variety of bad guys.”Co-Optimus“The animations in the game are great. The combination of colorful graphics and precision-based platforming and combat is a nice throwback to the old-school of gaming like Ghost & Goblins and Ghostbusters, where timing and reflexes are essential for making it through the levels.

It is very cartoony, with each character having a lot of little quirks and details (I am particularly enamoured with the goblin mages branch arms, and the cute baby-like Cyclops), and the animations are very smooth and well produced. The game has a very vast and varied cast of characters, which could appear quite jumbled when appearing together, and yet stylistically all fit beautifully.”Hittin' Crits												关于这款游戏							Maia, the great Corgi Warlock, sets out on a quest to defeat the EVIL BUNNY KING and his army of undead minions. Based on a true story*, follow the exploits of Maia as she battles nefarious creatures of the BUNNY ARMY with her magic. Just a couple of the dangerous foes Maia will face include Narwhals throwing their horns (Warning: Narwhal horns are quite stabby.), Sheep with Torches (Warning: Sheep are flammable. Don't try this at home.), Salamander Rogues (Warning: All Salamanders are rogues.), and 67 other adorable yet deadly enemies.If Maia can't do it alone, she can team up with her pals The Prophet Pig-J (Origin: The Sties of the Undershire) , The Magic Pug (Origin: Unknown), and the Fish Mage (Origin: The Ocean). With their powers combined not even the dreaded Bunny King himself will stand in their path... Or so they hope.CORGI WARLOCK also features a 1-4 player vs. Battle Mode, for when you need to determine who does the dishes or if a Pug really is better than a Corgi.About the creator:Xander's Corgi Arcade is a one man shop, started by a former PIXAR, Dreamworks, and Sony animator, who decided to take a break and work on his own games for a while. His super amazing corgi, Maia, was the inspiration for it.
