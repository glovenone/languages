I highly recommend it.”(S)teamified“JSK has a solid foundation, it looks good and the wave-based platforming gameplay is a lot of fun but it only has a few levels and it does have a couple of balancing issues. If you’re a huge fan of old-school platformers I’d say go for it but if not it may be best to wait for a sale.”El Kemosabe												关于这款游戏							When the king is not at home, the bad things can be done...The peaceful tiny kingdom is now under attack from their old enemies, beings from the dark world...
