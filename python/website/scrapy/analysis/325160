In Bik, we follow a young boy who is abducted by aliens while on a camping trip with his friends. After joining forces with two friendly alien mercenaries, Ammut and Tatenen, Bik escapes from his abductors and tries to find his way home. Along the way, Bik and his newfound friends outsmart hijackers, (eat some brownies), accept a perilous mission to find a missing alien, (make some sandwiches), foil a dastardly plot by an evil corporate empire, (argue with disgruntled robots), and save a planet on the brink of destruction.Things to Do In BikPoint and click (or touch) your way through deeply atmospheric environments.Become absorbed in the world through an enthralling original soundtrack.Control multiple characters and see the story from different perspectives.Enjoy story-driven, thoughtfully crafted puzzles.Get abducted by aliens!Fire a laser gun!Befriend alien races and join them on adventures in space!Join a mercenary crew aboard a space freighter!And much more!More Reviews:“The dialogue is just superb in Bik, which always helps you invest in characters, and the standard is up there with Lucasarts or Sierra’s early efforts. This is not something I say lightly, having been initiated into the genre through Day of the Tentacle.”-4.5/5 Super Game Droid http://www.supergamedroid.com/2014/08/15/bik-a-space-adventure-review/“It’s one thing to make a game that looks retro, but it’s another to make a game that’s good and just happens to follow a classic aesthetic. Lucky for me, Bik is just such a game.”-4/5 RPGFan http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/Bik/index.html“I opened up my inventory, clicked on a bottle of booze, and then clicked on a dog in the scene. ‘Clearly Bik is in good hands for this adventure.’ was the message displayed. At that early moment I was sure Bik was going to be a pretty good game.”-4/5 RETRO http://readretro.com/reviews/bik/“A good old fashioned wholesome adventure game…featuring lots of murder!”-Some Guys PC Gaming Adventureshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Stn-SgbGtA“A charming adventure game throwback and well worth a play for fans of the genre.”-4/5 Gamezebo http://www.gamezebo.com/2014/08/20/bik-space-adventure-review-hot-like-plasma-grenade/-“If you love your pointy clicky adventuretitles then you are in for a treat with BIK …”-Indie Retro News“Bik is accessible to all ilks of players, whether an old school fan or a youngun’ to the scene, it has everything a player could want in a modern adventure game.” JayIsGames  http://jayisgames.com/archives/2014/08/bik.php“Bik is a fantastic game that not only emulates classic adventure games, but improves on them and is a top notch game in its own right.” -9/10 Android Rundown  http://www.androidrundown.com/app-rundown/bik-review/“Beautifully retro point and click with a classic space adventure story – we could ask for no more!” -4.3/5  TapSmart  http://www.tapsmart.com/games/review-bik-space-adventure-nostalgic-point-click-game/
