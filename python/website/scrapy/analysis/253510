For those already introduced to the tabletop game, they will find an excellent translation of the miniature combat, but now with living, breathing characters destroying each other as opposed to being put back in their foam. Those that have not yet joined into the geekcraft of wargaming will find an enjoyable, challenging player-on-player experience that is pleasing to the ear and the eye alike.”4/5 – Nerd Reactor“Gameplay, overall, in Warmachine Tactics is a blast. It’s not without its minor flaws, but getting to get into the nitty gritty of each unit and doing cool things like combined attacks, casting spells with your warcaster, or slamming your opponent to the ground with a warjack are sheer joy.”The Dread Gazebo“"I feel like someone opened the Ark and I wasn't closing my eyes..."”4.5/5 – Hot Pepper Gaming												关于这款游戏							In WARMACHINE, the very earth shakes during fierce confrontations where six-ton constructs of iron and steel slam into each other with the devastating force of a locomotive, where lead-spewing cannons chew through armor plating as easily as flesh, and where bold heroes set the battlefield ablaze with a tempest of arcane magic as they forge the fates of their unyielding nations in the fires of destruction.Take control of an elite battle mage known as a warcaster and his army of unstoppable warjacks and deadly soldiers in this intense and aggressive turn-based tactical combat game set in the award-winning, steam-powered world of the Iron Kingdoms.WARMACHINE: Tactics is a next-generation turn-based tactical game developed with the Unreal 4 engine.
