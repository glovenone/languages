All of those details look even better in Deluxe, preserved in the new vibrant HD visuals — the same goes for the catchy chiptunes soundtrack (with all new music for the ghost levels), and deliciously retro sound effects.”90% – Gamer Limit“I had great praise for this game before and so there is no doubt that I was going to hand it great praise once again. It is just as fun the second time around as it was the first time on the 3DS, with the original levels. The new levels and enhancements made it even more gratifying, and players don’t even have to wait long to experience the new ghost levels. As players beat an original level, the corresponding ghost level unlocks, giving them quick access to experience the spooky mudds.”90% – Fanbolt“Mutant Mudds Deluxe is the ultimate version of an already great game. Some tweaks to how it plays in addition to a fair amount of new content place it far above the original game. If you own the original but some things about it bothered you, give Deluxe a go. If you’ve never played the game, buy Deluxe as soon as possible. Mutant Mudds Deluxe is an outstanding throwback to another age, and it can’t be missed.”90% – Blazekick												关于这款游戏							Love pixels? Fond of platformers?
