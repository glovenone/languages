desc_long							评测						“It's amazing, the kind of experience that only comes from the tiny subset of games that work on me. Stark and understated, it's the interactive medium's answer to Ridley Scott's ALIEN.”Harvey Smith“...you should too, if you are not too deterred by the concept of a near-colourless journey of sound and survival through a pitiless void that tells you nothing and refuses to lend you any helping hand.”Rock Paper Shotgun“...the uncomfortable sound of someone struggling to breathe as you run out of oxygen is almost enough to induce panic.”The Verge												关于这款游戏							Capsule is a single-player survival game played entirely through a radar interface. Players navigate a hostile landscape, learn about their surroundings, and unravel a classic sci-fi story in the process. Best played in a dark room with headphones.NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PLAYERS WITH MISOPHONIA.In a strange and hostile place, something has gone very, very wrong. You wake up inside a small capsule, trapped, with no view of the outside world. The only way to survive is to use the radar screen and the capsule's simple controls to try and find more oxygen and more fuel... and to find out what happened.Capsule is a short game, approximately 2 hours for most players. Capsule is not a game for everyone; if you are claustrophobic, misophonic, and/or have anxiety or triggers related to asphyxiation and/or darkness Capsule may not be a good game for you.
