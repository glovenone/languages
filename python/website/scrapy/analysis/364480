desc_long							评测						“The art style of the game including the characters are just lovely, with a pretty impressive classical soundtrack that would sound good on any device”Indie Retro News“Red Goblin: Cursed Forest could very well be a winner, a tough-as-nails platform adventure – Metroidvania.”Alpha Beta Gamer“If you enjoy a bit of masochism in your spare time, the brutal and unforgiving 2D platforming of Red Goblin: Cursed Forest looks to challenge and reward you in equal measure”Hardcore Gamer												关于这款游戏							Venture into the darkness of the Dream Forest and discover why it's now called "Cursed". Meet interesting characters in a psychological adventure, solve puzzles and learn all about the story of Artuo, the knight who wants to be a wizard; Red, a fire goblin that was summoned by Artuo; Melchior, the wizard of dreams and his companions. Red Goblin takes inspiration from a host of old school retro platformers. With that in mind, you will die, a lot, and when you think you have mastered the game you will die again. However don't let that turn you off! Cause this game is not only beatable but offers secret powers that make the game experience a lot easier!Features:Explore 3 worlds; the Ice Caverns of Magi, the Cursed Forest, and the Nightmare FactoryDifferent endingsEerie musical soundtrackSecret Areas and abilitiesChallenging gameplayMagical pixel art world hand placed (No procedural worlds.
