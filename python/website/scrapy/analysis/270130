Call of Starseed may very well be one of the, if not the, most polished VR game I’ve ever played.”Upload VR“Gallery’s greatest strength is capturing the breathless feeling of a Goonies-esque adventure. It’s exhilarating (and sometimes frightening) to physically tread across abandoned beaches and crawl through strange old sewers. And that’s only the beginning of a ride that gets a lot more fantastical as it goes on.”Kotaku												关于这款游戏							The Gallery is an episodic, fantasy exploration game built for virtual reality, inspired by the mystery of dark 80’s fantasy adventure films.The Gallery - Episode 1: Call of the Starseed ™A strange message left by your mischievous twin sister, Elsie, will draw you into a mysterious journey filled with bizarre characters, a sinister presence and awe inspiring adventure.
