I frequently cried at the outcomes of the decisions I made for the Kaplan family.”Rock Paper Shotgun“While it arrives on the heels of other notable non-combat, story-based games, it still manages to feel fresh and emotionally resonant. This is thanks to sincere, realistic writing and an inspired approach to player choice, which has you picking sides and making difficult compromises in the context of family conflicts.”Polygon“The Novelist is the most personal and beautiful game I have ever experienced. The creator, Kent Hudson, has quite plainly poured his heart and soul into this game, and the outcome is genuinely something to behold. Never before have I felt so emotionally involved in the characters, their situation and potential future, as in this truly player-driven story.”10 out of 10 – GameGrin												关于这款游戏							The Novelist asks one central question: can you achieve your dreams without pushing away the people you love?
