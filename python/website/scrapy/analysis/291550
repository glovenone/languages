Every match is an epic test of skill, speed, and strength, and every victory brings additional glory and bragging rights to the winners.These slugfests are salted with powerful weapons and gadgets. Fighters scramble to grab swords, axes, hammers, blasters, rocket lances and more! Every weapon changes your play style and your options. Gadgets like mines, bombs, and spiked spheres add even more danger into the mix, letting fighters change the course of battle with a well timed-throw or carefully laid trap.Brawlhalla is a free to play, 2D platform fighting game featuring both online and local singleplayer/ co-op modes.   Online Ranked 1v1 - A personal test of skill where you match up against a single opponent to claim untold levels of personal glory in Brawlhalla.
