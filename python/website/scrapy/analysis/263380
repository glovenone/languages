A fun, light-hearted game, with a more serious story running beneath it. And once it’s over, there’s still more to do.”A Rare Gem – http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/03/15/wot-i-think-driftmoon/“It's been a long time since I enjoyed a game as much as this one. Think Quest for Glory and Frayed Knights mixed and blended together and you'll have some idea of what to expect.”4/5 – http://www.rpgwatch.com/show/article?articleid=206													Steam 青睐之光																															关于这款游戏							The beautiful, enchanted world of Driftmoon trembles in the shadow of a forgotten evil, for the dark King Ixal is again gathering his forces.Hope lies in an unlikely alliance: A young man joins forces with a little firefly dreaming of stardom, a panther queen with the ego of a moon whale, and a very determined fellow who's lost everything but his bones, and still hasn't given up.
