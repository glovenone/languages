desc_long							评测						“Each time the protagonist dies, you find yourself coming back with a vengeance, determined to try a new strategy, a different approach to her upbringing. It's borderline addictive. It's also likely to make a monster out of you. By the end of my first successful playthrough, I had summarily butchered everyone who even thought about looking at us funny, forced the princess into a continuous state of docility and lied my way through every social encounter possible. Was it evil? Yes. Was it glorious? Definitely.”http://indiegames.com/2012/06/review_long_live_the_queen_han.html“Somehow it never occurred to my princess, whom I’d lovingly crafted into a tense, paranoid warlord, that she shouldn’t empty a box of mysterious mailcandy into her mouth. You would think studying poison and espionage would have saved me from this espionage poison, but instead, a list of other skills, skills I never studied, princess skills, were key to avoiding this fate. I guess that’s the lesson: you can’t build a successful Arya without adding a little Sansa.”PCGamer“If you’re the sort who can sink your teeth into a full afternoon of tabletop strategy, you’ll be happy here. Long Live The Queen is a slow-paced, cozy evening kind of game, good for folks who like numbers and critical thinking. And death. Pink frosted, chubby cheeked death.”The Mary Sue													Steam 青睐之光																															关于这款游戏							Rule the world or die trying!Being a Princess is not an easy job.
