I had a spectacular, unforgettable adventure story to show for my three-hour adventure, and couldn’t wait to learn more about the world, its characters, and the human desire to discover.”9.0 – IGN“A fantastical reimagining of Jules Verne's novel, 80 Days captures the joy and melancholy of travel with unusual wit and humanity.”Kotaku“Videogames can take you on a thousand different adventures, but few offer the thrill of travel as 80 Days does. It’s a story game adaptation of Around The World In 80 Days, and it’s accordingly full of exciting, exotic locations to visit, with capers to pull, revolutions to incite and derring-do to perform at many of them... 80 Days is the most human game I’ve ever played. It is also, simply put, one of the best games I’ve ever played.”Rock Paper Shotgun												关于这款游戏							1872, with a steampunk twist.
