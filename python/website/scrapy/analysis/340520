With a shield that can absorb attacks, infinite jump capabilities, and kittens you can sacrifice for extra health, the game brings forth unique mechanics that make what would otherwise be a typical dungeon-crawler, exciting and fun.”4.5/5 – Indie Game Reviewer“McFarland made the grand slam decision to implement co-op into the game. This brings Tallowmere out of the generic dungeon roamer category and into a hilarious adventure to share with up to three friends in local co-op.”8.5/10 – APG Nation												关于这款游戏							Indulge Lady Tallowmere and see how far through her lovingly violent dungeons you can delve in this 2D indie action roguelike-inspired platformer. New rooms are procedurally generated every time you play, meaning you'll have to be on your guard for every randomly-placed enemy, elite, boss, and treasure chest you'll come across.Each room gets progressively bigger, harder, and more rewarding the further you go.The concept is simple yet hard to master:Raise your shield to block enemy attacks.Lower your shield and strike your foes when the timing is right.Jump or move to avoid traps, or use your shield to reduce damage taken.Find the key to advance to the next room.Collect weapons, outfits, headgear, and shields of various rarities to aid your journey.Turn in souls from slain enemies to increase your base stats and passive abilities.Stay alive as long as you can!Brace yourself as you learn the quirks of each foe, trap, and room type so you can strive for that "one more run" high-score victory! Each dungeon is infinite in length so it's up to you to push your limits; local scoreboards and online leaderboards let you track your greatest efforts.Available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
