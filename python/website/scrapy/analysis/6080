desc_long								关于这款游戏							Thrillville™: Off the Rails lives up to its name with 20 death-defying rides so outrageous, they inspire the same word from every park visitor who sees them:  “WHOA!” Players build these incredible “WHOA Coasters” to leap from one track to another, launch through the air like cannonballs, blast through a burning ring of fire and more.				But the new fun doesn’t stop there. Off the Rails features 34 playable multiplayer minigames, 15 all-new theme areas, over 40 thrill rides, a new story that ties together more than 100 missions, and social interaction with park guests that’s better than ever. The in-depth conversations both advance the plot and suggest better ways to manage the park. But is every guest to be trusted?				Experience the visceral fun of interacting with a theme park you create.				Build and ride your own creations, talk and joke with all your guests, and play dozens of minigames.				Visit 15 themed areas, like Battleville, Winterville, Spaceville and Aeroville, all spread throughout five new parks.				Create 20 death-defying WHOA Coasters such as:				Hotrod Stunt - A nitro boost propels a car across a broken track.				Pendulizer - A giant arm grabs the car just before a gap in the track, whips it around in a full circle, then sets it down on the other side.				Escape Drop  - The track holds the car stationary as it lifts itself from level ground to a full 90-degree drop. Then it lets go.								Distinguish your rides even more with enhanced customization options. Attach animatronics, flowers and flaming hoops to all of your coasters and rides.				Play 34 minigames – 14 new, 20 returning from the original Thrillville but with new levels.
