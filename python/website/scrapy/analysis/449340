The game also features a dynamic debate system that allows Odell to argue certain points in court based on her accumulated stats.Key FeaturesBranching Narrative : Every decision made as Odell will change the story -- whether it’s getting closer to finding the murderer, stabilizing the kingdom, or helping the next monarch rise to power.Stats Management: Odell’s decisions will affect her stats, which will help her debate her beliefs in court.Debate Mini-Game: The game features an entertaining mini-game where Odell (with the help from the stats she’s earned on her journey) will debate a variety of topics to uncover new, important information.Girl x Boy / Girl x Girl Romances: Just because Odell is ruling a kingdom doesn’t mean she won’t save some time for romance :)Voice Acting: Serafina’s Crown features a cast of talented voice actors that bring the story to life.Story & GameplayThe sequel takes place seven years after the end of Serafina’s Saga.
