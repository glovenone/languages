desc_long								关于这款游戏							The day started like any other....  But then, just as you were enjoying a walk with your sister, she was kidnapped by evil space robots!   You could have been taken as well but you were lucky and escaped.  ...But what of your sister?  Can you save her from these monsters - or will you die trying?  If you're brave enough then you will have to negotiate a series of challenging physics based puzzles in a world of traps and monsters....  Welcome to the darker reaches of my imagination. Umbra: Shadow of Death has seven large levels of puzzles for you to conquer. On your journey you will encounter.... Ah, heck, why should I tell you what will happen? You'll be confronted by puzzles, traps, monsters and robots! You'll also get to drive a high-performance truck and shoot a mini-gun....! If you're not sure - try the Demo...Umbra is a 2d physics platformer that will take up a couple of hours of your time... If your hardware has less than 1Gb of video memory and you don't have DirectX support then the game may not run smoothly. The game is designed to be played using an Xbox360 controller; keyboard/mouse control is supported - but the game may not feel as good to play (using a laptop trackpad is not recommended). Steam Achievements are supported, so you can share your intellectual and hand/eye coordination superiority with your friends. The game may not run smoothly or in full screen on older / min spec hardware.
