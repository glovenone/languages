desc_long							评测						“The game's strong writing carries it through, and earns it a place among the greatest indie RPGs.”9.0/10 – Game Chronicles“Fans looking to get into the Avernum series will do very well with Escape from the Pit, and while the improvements beyond the game engine and visuals are relatively modest, there's still a lot to enjoy even if you've played through the game once before already.”–GameBanshee“It is a tribute to indie gaming as a whole that a game made by such a tiny team can swell into such an involving, engrossing and glorious fantasy epic.”9.0/10 – The Digital Fix“If you're looking for a complex single player RPG and value content at the expense of visuals, don't miss this title.”8.0/10 – Impulse Gamer“Spiderweb Software have provided a vast world in which to get lost, and a hefty quest in which to sink your teeth, which will reward those who can overlook its lack of finesse with many hours of enjoyable adventure.”–Indie Game Magazine												关于这款游戏							Avernum is an epic fantasy role-playing adventurer set in an enormous, subterranean nation.
