We have worked extensively with third party developers to make sure the two products can work alongside each other, however due to the wide range of add-on products available for MSFSX, we cannot guarantee that your existing content will work with Microsoft Flight Simulator X Steam Edition.The Flight Simulator X Software Development Kit (SDK) is not included with FSX: Steam Edition.If you already have MSFSX installed on your PC and are concerned about running the two games alongside each other, you may wish to consider installing FSX: Steam Edition on a separate PC. If you already have MSFSX and add-ons installed they will only be accessible through your existing installation. They will not be duplicated across the original edition and Steam Edition of the simulator.Included AircraftAugusta Westland EH101 (Helicopter)Airbus A321AirCreation 582L Trike UltralightBeechcraft Baron 58Beechcraft King Air 350Bell 206B JetRanger (Helicopter)Boeing 737-800Boeing 747-400Boeing F/A-18Bombardier CRJ700Bombardier LearJet 45Cessna C172SP SkyhawkCessna C208B Grand CaravanDe Havilland DHC-2 BeaverDG Flugzeugbau DG-808SDouglas DC3Extra 300SGumman G21A Goose Maule M7 OrionMaule M7 Orion (on skis)Mooney BravoNorth American P-51D MustangPiper J-3 CubRobinson R22 Beta II (Helicopter)
