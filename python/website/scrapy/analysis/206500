desc_long									Steam 独家优惠									Two Portal themed items are now available to all Steam players:Companion Cube - Found in the ruins of a long abandoned facility, there's something about this utilitarian cube that compels you to keep it at your side. It follows your AirMech in battle acting as a faithful companion Pet until the end! Can be equipped in a Flair slot on any AirMech.Sentry Turret - Blueprints for this turret were found in a large underground facility in use before the War. They seem to have been designed for use against humans, so this version is equipped with armor piercing rounds to make it more viable against the robot armies used in battle today. They are light and cheap, only effective against weaker units, but you can build a lot quickly to make them useful.																						关于这款游戏							AirMech is fast paced Action RTS that can be played like Dota or Starcraft--you can battle on the ground or command from the skies!
