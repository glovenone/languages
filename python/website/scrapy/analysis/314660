desc_long							评测						“The grace with which the plot unfolds and the relevance it still has for the real world remain something of an anomaly”9/10 – Eurogamer“More than just a remake, this is a contemporary puzzle-platformer that charms, exasperates, and delights. This is how you do a reboot.”5/5 – Escapist“Not just an excellent port of a great title, but a solid game in its own right, Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty is fully able to proudly rub shoulders with any puzzle-platformer released in the last ten years.”9/10 – God Is A Geek													Control Help and Tips									Struggling with Abe and the controls?Tip: One of the quickest ways to make the controls in New 'n' Tasty a little easier is by switching on the two 'old school' control toggles, which are off by default. These tighten up Abe's movement and make lateral hops much easier to pull off.Once on, Abe will no longer run without the player pressing the 'run' button, and will hop to the side rather than straight up, making mines easier to leap over and distances easier to judge.Re-mapping the controls:New 'n' Tasty supports in-game remapping for controllers and keyboards.To remap a controller, ensure the "Input Method" is set to Controller, and then go to "Button Layout" and select "Xbox 360" at the top to bring up a dropdown. From the dropdown, select "Custom" and then remap as needed.Supported controllers:Windows: Xbox 360; Xbox One; DualShock 4, Steam Controller; Logitech F310, F510, F710; XInput compatible. Others may be configured via in-game remapping tool. Please refer to minimum specs for other formats.																						关于这款游戏							Back To OddworldExplore ancient ruins, dodge carnivorous beasts and avoid trigger-happy guards as Abe, the original Oddworld hero in this lovingly recrafted, built from the ground-up and totally recooked take on the classic adventure Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee.
