Ambient music combine well with an interesting puzzle concept that results in accessible mathematics for those that can endure feeling like they’re winning one second and realizing they’re losing the next.”8.5/10 – Games Ring“Si vous adorez les mathématiques, si vous aimez faire fonctionner votre cerveau, si vous raffolez de bonne musique, si vous jouez uniquement aux niveaux très difficiles dans les jeux, alors, n’attendez plus ! Le jeu Bacteria est sur Steam pour moins d’un euro, ne vous privez pas !”http://www.graal.fr/2016/04/12/test-bacteria-la-version-pour-steam/“Bacteria is one of those funny games that in some ways can’t really be considered a game. Sure it has puzzle levels, but the main fun lies in just throwing things onto the screen and seeing what happens. If you’re interested in Conway’s Game of Life or you just like watching pretty patterns then you cannot go wrong with Bacteria. It’s advertised as a relaxing puzzle game and it really delivers on the relaxation.”Final Boss Fight													More puzzle games!									http://store.steampowered.com/app/415960/http://store.steampowered.com/app/375010/																						关于这款游戏							'Bacteria' - A new puzzle game from the creators of 'Energy Balance' and 'Energy Cycle'. This game is based on the rules of the cellular automaton ‘Life’ devised by John Horton Conway in 1970.(You can read more about how it works in greater details here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life ) In 'Bacteria' you have a square game field that is in some form of a stable state.  You need to add in a certain number of cells so that, after a few steps, the field will be halted (in colored mode) or even cleared (in "hard" black & white mode).  You could draw in single points, or use standard 'Life' patterns like "Gliders" (they move at an angle) and "Lightweight spaceships (LWSS)" (they move in a straight line). Depending on the difficulty level, the player can use a smaller area to add new cells.
