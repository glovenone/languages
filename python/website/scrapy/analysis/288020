Rex Rocket is very nearly that exact amalgamation of ingredients and is as good as you might have expected. It’s got all of the trimmings of either style of platformer and then some.”8/10 – G3AR“As a game designed to cater to nostalgia, Rex Rocket serves both as a wonderful reminder of those platforming glory days and a welcoming addition to the modern gaming scene.”4/5 – Another Castle												关于这款游戏							Tell me about Rex Rocket!Inspired by the glorious retro days of 8-bit gaming, Rex Rocket is a traditional 2D platformer that pays tribute to classic NES games like Mario, Mega Man, and Metroid.
