And you’re not entirely wrong, but I haven’t seen one myself that does it this well, or that has this much going on.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun“It’s quite clear that Emilios Manolidis has put a lot of effort into this project [...] After all, solo development projects are by no means an easy task, but it’s clear that this guy has worked his butt off to provide a finished product worthy of being played.”Games Ring“An excellent turn-based strategy game with in-depth gameplay that hooks you with a case of "Just one more turn".”8/10 – Game Skinny												关于这款游戏							Emerge: Cities of the Apocalypse places players in a dystopian world filled with zombies and mutated creatures.
