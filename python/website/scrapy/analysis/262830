It's unpretentious and straight-forward in its delivery, and yet, underneath its façade rests an addictive top-down shooter with solid mechanics and a hardcore slant.”7.5 / 10 – IGN“Crimsonland is a quality twin-stick shooter.”7 / 10 – Game Informer“If you like shooting infinite hordes of monsters from a top-down perspective, Crimsonland is one of the best options you have.”4 / 5 – Hardcore Gamer Magazine												关于这款游戏							Thousands of aliens, zombies, giant spiders, mutant lizards, and more are on the attack - can you survive the onslaught?

Perks are like talents in an RPG game. You earn XP by killing monsters and with XP you earn levels. After leveling up you get to choose a perk. For example, a perk called Fastloader  enables you to reload extremely fast. During a session perks will stack up a and every game will be a bit different. You'll unlock perks during the quest mode after which they become available in the survival game modes.We've created a huge arsenal of 30 unique weapons ranging from the humble pistol to the mysterious Shrinkifier 5k. The weapons are unlocked by playing the quest mode and they become available in survival game modes as well. The better your arsenal  - the better chances you have at scoring higher outside the quest mode.Crimsonland features up to four player local co-op.
