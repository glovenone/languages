That heart shines through the rough edges, and in some ways even turns them to its advantage.”8/10 – Destructoid“Chroma Squad is terrifically enjoyable. Fans of tactical RPGs will have oodles of fun, and those who also look fondly upon the youthful days of the Power Rangers will get an extra kick.”8/10 – Twinfinite“The greatest Power Rangers game there never was.”Rock Paper Shotgun												关于这款游戏							Chroma Squad is a tactical RPG about five stunt actors who decide to quit their jobs and start their own Power Rangers-inspired TV show!
