The most interesting aspect of this title is its total reliance on audio, and zero use of visual art. The game features full 3D environments, outlined in details through directional audio and cues, and even features a surprisingly challenging combat system. It's a game full of twists, throwing in numerous styles of gameplay from stealth, horse-riding, combat, and even careful navigation of treacherous terrain. Needless to say it's full of surprises that you might not expect to be possible to develop in a game without visual direction.”Next Power Up“”Journal du gamer												关于这款游戏							A Blind Legend is the first-ever action-adventure game without video – where ears replace eyes!Discover the original, innovative sensory experience of binaural 3D sound.HEADPHONES ARE COMPULSORY!AUDIO GAME FULLY ACCESSIBLE TO BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLEYour eyes will be of no help.So close them, sharpen your hearing and your blade...And embark on an epic, perilous rite of passage.Live the adventures of Edward Blake, the famous blind knight!
