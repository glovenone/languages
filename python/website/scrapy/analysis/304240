Supplies are scarce as they struggle to stay alive.GraphicsMore detailed graphics that retain the horror.The environments come alive with detail thanks to resolution upgrades and non-static 3D models.Post-processing effects like Bloom filters, which were not easy to do at the time of the original release, have been added to make the HD graphics even more realistic.High-Resolution Environments - We've increased the resolution of the background environments by recreating them with a mix of high-res static images, plus animated 3D models.Widescreen SupportWidescreen (16:9) is supported, so players can experience a greater sense of immersion.In widescreen mode, the screen will scroll.
