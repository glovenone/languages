And remember, in space, no one can hear you scream as you die for the forty-second time."Twonk Hammer"The tired old roguelike mechanic of running away gets more tense when you can’t see if the monster is still chasing you, and if it’s gaining on you!"Dragon Chasers												关于这款游戏							A deadly plague ravages your world.
