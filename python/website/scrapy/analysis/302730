The game is played from the first person; you will see the world through the eyes of king’s daughter, who was overthrown by the brutal Iron Lord. We selected Steam Punk as a style of the game, which means that you will find many interesting puzzles, interactions with objects and mechanisms. The player will have to escape from the air prison, find the Great Prophet in magic forest, reveal the secret of the Iron Lord, sneak into his citadel and rid Namariel from cruel tyrant. We tried to invent something new, for example there is “mind reading device” in the gameplay; by using this item you’ll be able to divine thoughts of characters, who are unable to communicate with you. Also you will have a robot assistant at your disposal, his name is Jim, he will help you in solving quests, and also, from time to time you’ll be able to switch controls of both main character and Jim to walk through levels with his assistance. Large game world, many magnificent locations and lots of pleasant animation; by the way, animation is what we are especially proud of, because we are a small studio, but we really wanted to do our best in terms of quality, so that you would like it. In spite of the linear gameplay, at the same time there is a freedom in choosing several quests to resolve, not connected among themselves, we don’t lead you by the hand, giving you rein to choose. Dozens of brain-teasers, mini-games and innovative solutions, ranging from simple mini-games in two moves to advanced mode mini-games, where help of your assistant may be needed.
