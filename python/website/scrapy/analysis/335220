It’s more of a slow burn than other match-3 games, requiring cold, calculated actions on behalf of the player. That threw me off at first, but – flawed though it is – I found myself having a lot of fun with it.”Gamezebo“There seems to be a movement in the indie scene towards these very peaceful, gentle, Zen-like puzzle games. It’s like developers are deconstructing what a game is, reinventing what has traditionally been a very challenge-driven, competitive, high-pressure medium. Within that context, But to Paint a Universe succeeds admirably, and casual gamers could certainly do worse than pick it up”Indie Game Reviewer												关于这款游戏							Follow the story of a little girl as she struggles to restore a sky broken by an evil monster in But to Paint a Universe!
