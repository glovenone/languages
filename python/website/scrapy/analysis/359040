desc_long							评测						“Between its interesting duo, unconventional art-style, and absorbing story, The Music Machine is a highly recommended title...”8/10 – Rely on Horror“It’s when the two stories diverge from each other that they reach their peaks: the drama and the horror, separate but unyielding, pelting me with empathy and fear in unspoken agreement.”N/A – Kill Screen Daily“As usual for anything from this genre it’s not for everyone, it’s not jump scares and gore, but it’s a fantastic story. Unique and quietly unsettling”9/10 – Bitparade												关于这款游戏							Haley, an eccentric 13 year old girl, has a complicated relationship with her old friend Quintin. He's a ghost now, and he's puppeting her body with the intent of finding a satisfactory way of killing her. This dubious quest has led them to a mysterious abandoned island, where several people were recently murdered.  And where, among the rotting cabins and dense trees, a strange new building hides a bizarre secret..."He met a man an eyeless man a toothless man and he looked at the man and the man looked at him and he saw that the man was beloved and dearest of friends and the man spoke to him 'how long since you've tasted bone marrow' and he told him he told him truthfully and the man said 'come' and he came with the man and they vomited pure cold clean water into the endless eternal infinite sea and then, the end."    FEATURESBlend of non-linear exploration, puzzle solving, and narrative, similar to The Vanishing of Ethan CarterHorror based on an atmosphere and story rather than jumpscares or chase scenesThis is not a Unity Asset Store collection.  Modeling, music, environments, and programming were done from scratch.  Sound effects were manufactured from creative commons samples.Rich storyline that stands on its own, but also expands on the plot of The Moon SliverStylish monochromatic visual style that enhances the feeling of mystery and uneaseAtmospheric original soundtrack (which can be purchased as DLC, or purchased here)A short but satisfying narrative experience that can be completed in one sitting
