Natural Soccer is a highly-rated game that delivers an intense realistic experience that all soccer fans owe it to themselves to play.”nVIDIA (Tegrazone Editor)“It's like Sensible Soccer but faster paced and more fun. Either alone, or with a friend, this game is hours of excitement and addiction. With the option of quick play, this game is already better than FIFA!”Green Man Gaming (Staff Pick)“What a goal!!! ... In short, believe me and buy Natural Soccer because it worths every single cent of its small price.”81 – GMG Review												关于这款游戏							Natural Soccer is a highly playable arcade soccer game with fast-paced action, accurate physics and intuitive controls.If you are a fan of classics like Kick Off, Sensible Soccer, Mircroprose Soccer, Goal! or Tekhan World Cup, Natural Soccer is for you!Key Features  Fast paced action  Accurate and fun ball physics  Full and direct control of the ball, including "Aftertouch"  Smooth graphics (60fps) with our proven and loved top-down view  Simple and intuitive controls - easy to learn, hard to master  Up to 4 players against each other or local-coop   Very fine-tuned gameplay for maximum playability  Over 200 teams with more than 2.200 individual, carefully crafted players (due to licensing rights, no real names, sorry!)
