Players build cities, castles and fortifications; construct mechanical devices and engines; perform landscaping and underground mining.The game is inspired by real medieval technology and the way people built architectural works and mechanical equipment using medieval technology. Medieval Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and history and doesn't use any technologies that were not available in the 5th to 15th centuries.Medieval Engineers concentrates on construction aspects, but can be played as an action game too. We expect players to avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications. Medieval Engineers shouldn’t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.Medieval Engineers is the second “engineering” game developed by Keen Software House. The first one is Space Engineers, which sold over 1 million copies in its first year and is still a bestseller.Early AccessGame modes - Creative - unlimited resources, instant building, invulnerability, levitation - Survival - this mode is work-in-progress. Currently available: death/respawn, survival building, resource management, inventory, character stats (health, stamina, food)Single-playerMultiplayer - alpha version (not final) - Creative and survival mode with your friends - Cooperative: build together with your friends, protect your castles/cities from barbarian raids - Competitive: battle against other players - Privacy customization: offline, private, friends only, public - Max 16 players (this may increase in the future)Character crafting - craft your tools using the basic resources such as scrap wood or small stonesDedicated servers - players can connect to a third party host, rather than using a player-host, in a peer-to-peer set-up. The result is a faster connection and a more fluid multiplayer performance with less lagBarbarians - first prototype of enemy AIBarbarian waves (survival mode) - barbarians will attack players in waves during the nightWeapons - Crossbow, swordFirst-person & Third-personBlock types: - Small: 0.25 meter (25 centimeters) - Large: 2.5 meters - Dynamic: can be used to construct carriages and machinery that is supposed to be moved around - Static: immovable and connected to earth; if a heavy load breaks its structural integrity it cracks and unsupported parts become dynamicBuilding blocks: stone walls (various shapes - from blocky to rounded), wooden walls and flooring, roofs (ceramic, thatched, hay), power source blocks (manual human labor), stored energy blocks (torsion spring), leverages, weights, swings, ropes, wooden beams of various length and shape… More will be added in future!Realistic physics – structural integrity, destructible objects (everything: from blocks to terrain), real proportions, volume, mass, storage capacity, integritySteam Workshop – share your creations with the CommunityModding - world files, 3D models, textures, shaders, API (scripting in-game objects in C#)64-bitWorld management – generate new worlds, “save as” to multiple copies, auto-save every 5 minutes (can be turned on/off), edit world settingsMore to be added laterPlease be sure to read the list of current features before you buy the game. It will give you an insight on what is or isn't actually working: http://www.medievalengineers.com/features.htmlPerformance NotesMedieval Engineers is in development and undergoing frequent optimizations. The performance will get better.  The performance depends on the complexity of your world and the configuration of your computer. Simple worlds run smoothly even on low-end computers, but a more complex world with rich object interactions could overload even high-end computers. Minimum requirements represent the bare minimum to run simple scenes and don’t guarantee a perfect experience.
