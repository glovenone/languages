You are welcome, internet.”Wired UK“Hashtag Dungeon takes the gameplay of games like The Binding of Isaac, and combines it with the collaborate nature of the social gaming phenomenon of Twitch Plays Pokemon (well, kind of).”Gamazoid“I was quite intrigued by #Dungeon even before sitting down to chat. Now that the interview's finished, I actually can't wait for the game to launch. It's clear that the two are incredibly passionate about what they do, and that this is a project they definitely want to see through to the end. They're exactly the kind of developers the industry needs.”Inventorspot												关于这款游戏							Something evil is stirring in the depths of the world.
