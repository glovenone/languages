desc_long								关于这款游戏							Driveby Gangster is a 1930's era game where you assume the role of a vigilante out-of-work private eye. Your goal is to eliminate the enemy gangsters that have invaded your quaint west-coast city while avoiding innocent bystanders. Grabbing your trusted thompson (tommy) submachine gun, you take to the streets to dispense justice one driveby at a time. Various obstacles get in your way from innocent bystanders that you must avoid, increasingly hostile gangsters that shoot back, to changing turbulent weather conditions. As you play and progress in the game, Murphy's own grasp on reality begins to loosen, and the game's presentation style takes a dark turn.Like in life, the decisions you make in this game have consequences.
