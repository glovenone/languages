desc_long								关于这款游戏							“La Péri” is a short (10-15') narrative-driven experience based on classical music, ballet performance captured with mocap and exclusively made for roomscale VR. It relies a lot on interactions of the hand controllers, to make us able to play directly with the character and feel a deep sense of presence. The HTC VIVE headset allowed us to create an experience where anyone will be able to feel true presence on stage... The viewer is no longer a distant observer, but lives the choreography from the inside and can appreciate a dancer's performance as never before.In this experience , choreography, visual processing, music and story-line will merge into one, producing an extraordinary audio-visual experience.On the stage, you play the role of Iskender, a prince seeking the "flower of immortality". This precious artifact is guarded by la Péri, an ancient spirit. As you gradually fit into your role and try to take possession of the flower, the spirit appears. Alternately frightened and mischievous, it evolves into different living forms that increase in complexity until it sketches a graceful, feminine silhouette…
