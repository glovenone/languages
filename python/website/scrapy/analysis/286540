The graphics are amazing, the puzzles are tightly constructed and logical, mini-games are creative and challenging, and there are enough extras to keep you entertained for hours.”5/5 – Gamezebo												关于这款游戏							The fate of the magical world is in your hands – free it from evil! There is a new threat looming over Nearwood: all of a sudden, winter has come down upon the land. The once green and lush landscape is now locked in ice and covered with snow, driving away the gnomes from a quiet village on the outskirts of the kingdom. Fey the Advisor again calls upon Jane for help, and together they inch their way towards the source of the cold – which turns out to be more than a mere fluke of weather. An ancient evil has awakened to take hold of Nearwood: the powerful Killiman is back for revenge after thousands of years spent in captivity between the two worlds. As Jane and Fey explore new locations, they help the villagers survive the freeze, while once again saving Nearwood from the clutches of impending doom!Collector's Edition Features:Beautiful desktop wallpapers Soundtrack and concept art Bonus activity: finding cute little creatures (Snoop-Sees) hiding in each scene The ‘Snoopedia' Plus, an exciting bonus chapter!
