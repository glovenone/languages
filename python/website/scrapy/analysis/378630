Both are worthy protagonists – intelligent, mature and practical in their own ways – and their subtle but undeniable chemistry shines past the blatant conflicts.”4/5 – Adventure Gamers“What's particularly convincing, in general, is the concatenation of events, which results in a very enjoyable plot, in addition to an interesting psychological development of the two main characters.”7/10 – Spazio Games“The graphics are consistently well drawn and full of detail, and I particularly enjoyed the orchestral/choral soundtrack in Shadows on the Vatican. The voice acting is convincing and varied, and some of the character clichés are amusing.”B+ – GameBoomers												关于这款游戏							When Silvia is hunted by the person behind the attempted murder she was assigned to commit, she knows the only option remaining is to face the deadly conspirator openly. In the heart of the local underworld, Silvia will discover a game of power in which everyone is an expendable pawn. A forced alliance with her ex-target seems to be the only way to avoid the inevitable, but if they want to dispel the secretive mists of the Vatican, James and Silvia will have to come to terms with their limitations...
