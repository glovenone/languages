You must identify and exploit your enemies' weaknesses, neutralizing their superior numbers and firepower with surprise, subversion, cunning and of course brute force.

Grab your Molotov cocktails or flamethrowers to take out your enemies.					Destructible environment  No more obstacles: Everything is breakable and alterable, even in Multiplayer mode. The DUNIA engine's RealTree technology also delivers the most realistic nature deterioration system ever.

Take on over 70 side missions to earn valuable information, new weapons and vehicles.					Non-scripted artificial intelligence  Medics will drag wounded soldiers to safety.
