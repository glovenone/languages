They’re beautiful, in a nightmarish sort of way, and you’ll be seeing them in your head long after you stop playing.”Games in Asia“You may be surprised (and more than a little pleased) to learn that there’s not a single mention of the zombie apocalypse. The dead remain inanimate, safely ensconced six feet under. Motte Island has chosen a far great adversary for you to contend with, one we’re sure will strike fear into your hearts.”LaptopZombie													Steam 青睐之光																															关于这款游戏							A brother has to save his sister in what appears to be a plot by dark forces.
