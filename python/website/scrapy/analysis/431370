Simply put, a diorama is a painting you can visit with a simple goal of inspiring a sense of wonder. They are an ideal retreat to ponder and be somewhere else.The Marchland is the third entry in 'The Shoebox Diorama' series, an ongoing series of fantastical dioramas for VR devices by interactive illustrator 'Daniel Ernst'. A diorama can be explored as a standalone experience or as an interconnected experience through the ‘Table of Contents’ diorama (coming soon), which serves as the central hub.Visit a tollbooth where the visitor can experience what it feels like to be in between the real and virtual world and become a poltergeist of some sorts. You're invisible, but you will see, feel and hear objects in the environment react to your touch. You can walk through walls, knock on windows, and ruffle the plants. Or take a seat in the rain and watch as the invisible cars pass by. Before you know it, you have crossed over into ‘The Marchland’.Other dioramas in the series include: http://store.steampowered.com/app/431390
