desc_long								关于这款游戏							In the dead of winter, a major corporation threatens to seize control of the farmland to build a new mall. The whole town will need to come together to make enough money to buy it back, or face extinction. But in the coldest winter in decades, the conditions make farming almost impossible. Ancient farming secrets must now be unlocked as you are forced to learn to grow crops in winter and make friends and enemies in an equally icy social climate.Player OptionsPlay as either gender and choose a partner who will help you put a stop to the megamall and keep the tension between the townsfolk down amidst the stress.Explore Exotic LandsTake to the skies in an air balloon to holiday in exotic lands under the guise of seeking out new farming secrets.Story-based GameplayCharacter development, varied dialogue and side quests break up the joyous monotony of farming.Barn and BreakfastGive the old barn and chicken coops a second life by allowing visitors to stay in them to make a few extra dollars for the town. Wait on them hand on foot and feed them daily just as you would a real chicken or cow.Special AbilitiesExplore ancient caves to unlock access to additional ancient caves and attain greater winter farming and cooking mastery.A YetiMany doubt the existence of the yeti, but there are those who have seen him with their own eyes. Will his legend be confirmed, or is he just a false beacon of hope?Market DaysCome together with the community to put on special themed market days, where buyers emerge from faraway lands for a chance to buy rare delicacies like mushroom soup, and hand-crafted furniture.PartiesBad weather won't keep anybody at home as a new party will be held every week. Parties represent a chance to woo girls (or boys) and help you get to know people (which leads to quests).Critter ConnectionBefriend wild critters and gain their love by feeding them expert cooking recipes lovingly crafted in your own house. Collect a variety of animals on your farm and nurture them so they will in turn help you unlock ancient farming secrets.
