desc_short	-----								Mysterious Space was originally created for the 2014 7-Day Rogue-Like competition, but has received many updates since! It features many familiar rogue-like elements - including potions, equipment, and procedurally-generated worlds - but is ultimately a side-scrolling action shooter.
