The Steam version is based on the Shmups Skill Test included in the arcade game Shooting Love 2007.The arcade version is a long running hit, still to be found in arcades across Japan, despite many of its peers from the same time (2007) having been long removed. Its arcade sequel, included in Game Center Love. ~Plus Pengo!~, is also still going strong.Furthermore, despite having been developed as an “examination” or “training” game, the versus play proved exciting enough to create the demand for competitions being held, something of a rarity for a shooting game. The Steam version takes this one step further, adding new tests (games) and the ability to play with up to 4 players. You can also focus on practice with the newly added ability to choose specific tests.Of course, no shooting game would be complete without music. “Mr. Shooting Love Sound”, NAOTO returns but he's not alone. With him, we have two guests in the form of Go Sato (of Raiden series fame) and WASi303 (from the Psyvariar series).
