By day, explore the randomly generated woods, scavenge for materials and weapons, discover secrets, solve mysteries and talk, trade with or kill the various inhabitants of Darkwood.  By night, return to your hideout, barricade, set up traps and hide or defend yourself from the horrors that lurk in the dark.  Gain skills or perks by extracting essence from mutated fauna and flora and injecting it into your bloodstream. Each action you take will have impact on Darkwood and its inhabitants. The choices you make will define the story which you will experience. As days go by, the lines between reality and nightmarish fantasies will begin to blur. You will start to question the protagonist's sanity, but may also stumble upon your own hidden fears...
