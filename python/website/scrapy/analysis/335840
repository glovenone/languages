One corgi. Zero margin of error.Goats on a Bridge adapts the classic Norwegian fairy tale, Three Billy Goats Gruff, as an inventive new platformer that has players controlling not one, but two goats at the same time. That’s twice the capra-control of Goat Simulator! Sadly, this has the makings of a tragic tale.Tempo and Chubbs’ poor brother has been abducted by an evil troll, and it’s down to you to direct the pair as they jump, dodge and roll their way across a series of hazardous bridges to track down their lost sibling. There’ll be bizarre collectibles, accessory-selling amphibians and even an energetic corgi to help you on your adventures. Just be sure not to let your four-legged friends plummet into the water. That’d really get their goat.Features2 Different Game ModesSingle-player, co-operative and competitive herding10 time-based levels challenge players to secure all 3 starsVisit the Stash to admire your recently discovered Rainbow ToastA sophisticated frog sells bold accessories to customize your characters at the StumpDash Mode turns the game into a procedurally generated endless runnerSupports PS3™, PS4™, Xbox 360™ & Xbox One™ ControllersDoesn’t require much RAM… (yeah, we went there)
