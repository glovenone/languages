The choice of options provide a depth of play rarely seen. A choice of four skill levels, three mission areas (Middle East, Europe of the Americas), three basic crime-orientations (espionage, international crime or terrorism) and over a dozen of enemy operatives (at least half a dozen of which will be involved with each crime), Covert Action is a game that will take many hours of play to successfully complete.”90 – ACE (Advanced Computer Entertainment)“Apart from a fairly simplistic look, practically everything is up to the high-class standards expected from MicroProse, and it's only after really spending some time with it that you can come to appreciate the work involved.”88 – The One												关于这款游戏							Sid Meier's Covert Action - A Techno-Thriller From the Case Files of Max Remington.In the 1990's our national nightmares are haunted by wild-eyed political extremists, greedy and ruthless drug lords, and lunatic military dictators.
