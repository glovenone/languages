desc_long							评测						“Shadow Ops begins roughly three-quarters of the way through the story and then works its way backwards after letting you witness a truly horrific moment. The story itself is pretty much standard Hollywood fluff, so expect betrayals and some stiff banter in the cut-scenes. Shadow Ops makes use of standard first-person shooting techniques, but offers a very helpful lean function that actually is something other developers should rip off. Yes, lean has been used before, but it's very effective and even vital in ShOps.”7/10 – IGN“General movement is easy enough, and thankfully the standard control layout you would expect in a first person shooter is here. The action is fast paced, and you will have to keep on your heels to succeed in completing the missions, so a simplified control scheme is a godsend.”7/10 – GamesHell“If you’re looking for a decent shooter you’ve come to the right place. All of the sounds are superb and the audio separation comes through very clearly. To complement the gunfire and chaos is a heart thumping soundtrack that helps convey the situation. It goes for a sort of middle eastern chant that was prevalent all throughout movies like Black Hawk Down and Gladiator and it works really well here.”6.4/10 – Gaming Nexus												关于这款游戏							Race against time and terrorism as a member of the elite counter terrorist team in this all-out first person shooter.
