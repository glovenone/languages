The tiny team behind it have done remarkable things, far in excess of what many, much larger studios seem capable of. Those studios should be afraid – be very afraid.”ROCK PAPER SHOTGUN“The game’s atmosphere is thick with tension, but it’s not trying to make you sweat the whole time, so the few moments it breaks things up and hits you with something shocking, it really works.”KOTAKU“It's more than just "good for an indie game", it's a mandatory experience for fans of sci-fi horror.”9/10 [AMAZING] – IGN												关于这款游戏							VOTED BEST ADVENTURE GAME OF 2015! * STASIS is a point-and-click, sci-fi, horror adventure game played from a unique isometric perspective.
