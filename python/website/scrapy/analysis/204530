Who says a great RTS has to be a big budget studio endeavor?"--Tom Chick, Quarter To Three"Infested Planet is a game I’m excited to see evolve, as it has the potential to be a unique and engaging RTS unlike any I have played before."--Nightmare Mode"Infested Planet is already quite fun, and the current beta is being very actively expanded, refined and tuned. If you’re into strategy, this might well be worth keeping an eye on. After all, who knows what it could mutate into?" --DIY Gamer"The mutations are an ingenious way to mix each game up and keep the experience fresh."--WarGamer												关于这款游戏							Command a team of 5 elite soldiers against an alien horde of 100,000.
