I wouldn’t consider myself a wannabe Napoleon, but even so, if I ever master this game, I think I could probably give him a run for his money. Wargaming.net has a real winner in Massive Assault Network 2." - JustPressPlay (9.5 out of 10)										"The excellent graphics, animation and level design and all pull you into the game and greatly enhance the playing experience." - Gamers Hell, (8.5 out of 10)																	关于这款游戏							Massive Assault Network 2 is turn-based. However, it uses cutting edge 3D technology, which makes it look like RTS. Plus, the engine allows you to move a couple of units in a close sequence so that visually they move and shoot simultaneously producing RTS-style visual effects.						The game is based on the legendary Massive Assault series from which it inherits the best elements: original "Secret Allies" concept, streamlined turn-based gameplay, perfectly-balanced unit parameters, state-of-the art interface and endless replayability.						The gameplay is easy to understand, but difficult to conquer, and most importantly, very addictive. Lead your divisions, fleets and air squadrons to crush the enemies with no mercy!												A.I. opponents for training 						Fascinating 3D engine 						Fancy Camera captures the most dramatic moments 						Play multiple games simultaneously 						Find live opponents of any desired skill level 						25 beautiful planets, 42 units of all types
