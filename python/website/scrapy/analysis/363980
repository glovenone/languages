Organa, the main character, is working as an apprentice at her master Irene’s shop. Irene’s shop is one that raises mysterious plants that grow organs, which are then harvested and sold to the villagers. In the game, you’ll quickly click the plants and tools on screen and deliver plenty of organs.Irene’s requested organ deliveries are presented as quests. By completing a few quests, more customers will come, and the story will progress. Whether it’s to get Master’s praise, or to please the customer, click away and ship those organs!Creator’s Voice"My Organic Garden was an idea that has been floating around for a few years. Please enjoy a world where a few slightly odd organisms can exist normally."
