desc_long							评测						“The Game That Let Me Mourn My Lost Faith”Kotaku“I found the overall experience to be a fun, unique experience that lends itself to a variety of play styles, giving it a good amount of replay value. With a little more polish, it could become a cult classic.”8/10 – Darkstation“Cults And Daggers is not a slick game. It is not an easy game to whirl your time away within. It is thoughtful, slow, laborious, and very, very specific to its audience. It is a labor of love meant for a very niche audience, just as Humble warned us it would be.  And that’s why I think it’s worth looking into.”Conquistadork												关于这款游戏							Cults and Daggers is a strategy game set in the Hellenistic era between the death of the Buddha and the birth of Christ.You create your own religion and fight a secret war for the soul of the world.
