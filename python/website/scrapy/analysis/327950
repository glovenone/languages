In the same vein as Pirates, the game was not as successful, although game play, historical research and game atmosphere are near perfect. Duels, melee sequences and set-piece battles characterize this Oriental oeuvre.”80 – Computer Gaming World												关于这款游戏							Enter Japan in the age of warring states. At the center of this role-playing, action-adventure simulation of combat, statesmanship and intrigue, you are a samurai warrior struggling for honor. More important than life itself, honor is crucial to achieving your ultimate goal: unifying feudal Japan under your noble rule.Game Features:Computer-controlled opponents make decisions based on your actions - and on the actions of other rival characters.Furious melee action against multiple warriors takes place in castles, villages and rice paddies.Vindicate yourself in duels against rivals who would like nothing better then to diminish your Honor.Feel the drama and immediacy of real-time battles involving infantry, cavalry and muskets on battlefields that vary with every conflict.Untie all 48 warring provinces in common allegiance to you, and earn the title of shogun, military ruler of all Japan.Fun and Easy to control!Four skill levels, plus other starting optionsAn ingenious system of menus, animation and text windows - pioneered by MicroProse in Pirates! - conveys the detail of text with the fun of graphics and animation.Authentic Japanese music and graphics powerfully evoke the mood of Sixteenth century Japan.
