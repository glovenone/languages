desc_long							评测						“Overall, Fading Hearts is a pretty enjoyable visual novel/dating sim/RPG hybrid. It sets out to give the player a larger degree of freedom than found in others of its genre, and succeeds quite nicely.”4/5 – Twinfinite“It has an interesting story to tell, which can be as realistic, convoluted or outlandish as you want it to be.”TechnologyTell“... it went beyond what visual novels usually do and, as usual, I found the life-sim and RPG elements highly addictive.”87% – RPGFan												关于这款游戏							Your choices changes the GENRE of the story!Almost EVERY NPC LIES to you at some point in the game!Live a life of adventure or a normal life! A game with true choices!An interactive story/game where you play the role of Ryou, a seemingly normal high school student in the land of Sorayama. Solve the mysteries that surround him while maintaining his friendships and saving Claire. Remain ignorant of the secrets and live a normal life or choose to learn the truth. Be careful where you put your priorities for it may prove fatal. Multiple end-game climaxes and endings! What will be the final conflict? Take control of your story or be swept away by it unlike ever before! True choices! (Defined as choosing your own goal!)Daily Life Sim! Player-Led Game/Story Genre Shifting! Everyday choose what YOU want to do. Fight monsters in the forest on Monday. Hang out with friends on Tuesday. The player gets to choose!Player-Active Storytelling! NPCs tries to manipulate you, the player!This is what makes gamers like this game when they don't like Visual Novels and/or Dating Sims. Normally what you get is a storyline that you can sit back and just passively absorb. In Fading Hearts... Players can actively manipulate story mechanics once they understand how they work.Also there are many people trying to convince you to do things that may or may not be in your best interest. How do you figure out who to trust and not trust? Will you get enough information in time or would you have go with your gut feeling when it comes does down to the wire?
