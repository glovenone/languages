Ever since our Greenlighting, we've received so much love from everyone and we are humbled!Otaku Aniverse - Forgotten, Not Lost has two of the most important qualities needed to make a visual novel great. The most important part of any visual novel is a strong and thought provoking story that draws out emotions in the reader. This visual novel has a solid story that conveys an important message and puts you in the shoes of the main character. Another important feature that should be present in any visual novel is art that compliments the story and emotions. The art in this visual novel is simple but helps to set the mood as it was intended. I highly recommend this to visual novel fans who enjoy emotional stories and simple yet beautiful art.SUBALTERN GAMING - Forgotten, Not Lost is a great accomplishment for effectively instilling varying emotions into the writing and overall package of the game and successfully conveying this to the player. While the topic of dementia is sad in itself, it is handled well here and not overly pandering. The author of the story, Darren Kwok, based it off actual experiences caring for someone with dementia. Afterthought Studios’ in concert with the motto of Touching Hearts Through Words, created this short kinetic novel. It is a mature title backed by a mature–in professionalism at least–company. It’s short and inexpensive, and a great example of an indie title matching big-budget talent.Fuwanovel - It does what few VNs manage to do, by tackling a serious health, and psychological issue, in a very real, and relatable way.Hayurika - ... the story does leave the player with a deep feeling for the farmer and his illness, hopefully helping raise more awareness about dementia and Alzheimer’s in the long run.VNVortex - The art of the game is quite simplistic, but it fits the sorrowful theme very nicely – same can also be said for the music, which complements the whole package neatly.Meru's Reviews - The music (which I liked a lot), character sprites, and backgrounds are quite simple and subdued, but fittingly so, given the themes and setting, and they work together with the words to evoke a bittersweet atmosphere that veers between joyful and gloomy along with the protagonist’s changing moods.																						关于这款游戏							An old farmer lives with his wife - However, he hasn't quite been himself lately.
