desc_long								关于这款游戏							"Where's my Helmet?" is a platform game inspired by the old classics. Featuring original game mechanics, "Where's my Helmet?" allows the player to develop different strategies to progress through each level with a fun Nordic theme game. In this game, the player controls the character called Axel, who is equipped within a couple of axes which must be wisely thrown since you can't abuse of them because you must wait a while to recharge before throwing more, using either as a weapon or a climbing tool, allowing our hero to protect himself against the hordes of enemies and/or overcome the myriad of challenges and puzzles along the way.
