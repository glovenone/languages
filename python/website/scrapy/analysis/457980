desc_long							评测						“This does make for an incredible amount of challenge, as my play through of the game’s 2 level public demo took up to an hour & a half of figuring out my next move in avoidance of zombies & other obstacles obstructing my progress, failing to do so and then failing to carry out those moves when I did figure them out for the utter onslaught of environmental complexity in certain portions of the game. It was tough, but I enjoyed it.”Higher Eclectic Ground“Question: On a lighter note, which member of your team do you think would have the best odds of surviving a real zombie apocalypse? Why?  Answer: None of us! We are just a bunch of geeks with zero survival skills. Getting us off our computer screens would be scary enough to give any of us a heart attack.”Greenlight Games“After playing Adele for a while, you might have a strange sensation of a Tim Burton universe, mainly because of the skinny animated characters and the dark colors of the game. However, the surrounding world and plot are far from that. The odd, macabre background almost wants you to pause for a while to look into the never-ending horizon. Hat’s off to the artists for achieving that. The music and sound effects provide a dramatic atmosphere which blends itself well with the gaming experience.”http://playsterr.com/indie-review-adele-following-the-signs/												关于这款游戏							The year is 2029.
