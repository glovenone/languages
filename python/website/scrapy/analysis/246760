desc_long							评测						“Legends of Eisenwald is a diamond in the rough. It tries to do something I've never seen before, putting a focus on story, quest structure, as well as choice and consequence, which one almost always associates with a classical role playing game. It combines this with the game play of a turn based strategy game.”4/5 – RPGWatch“The combat system of the game is very different from what the genre normally offers, and there are moments when its bloody results and focus on placement and movement makes it feel revolutionary.”80/100 – Softpedia“Legends of Eisenwald is both a unique and quality game in a sea of clones, rehashes, and titles that disappoint.”Hardcore Casual													Knight's Edition									The Knight's Edition contains Legends of Eisenwald OST in MP3 and FLAC formats and artbook. The last two screenshots above in the carousel are from the arbtook.																						关于这款游戏							Legends of Eisenwald is an adventure game with tactical battles, RPG and strategy elements. Take the lead of a small feudal army and try to defend your right to survive in this ruthless medieval world. The mysterious lands of old Germany are waiting for you - it's a land where the superstitions of the time have come to life. This isn’t a fantasy game. There are no elves or dragons here. There are only people - and their passions, sins and fears that often take a tangible form. Which path will you choose? Live according to your conscience? Or live by power and might? Or will you live by justice? And what is your justice, really?Game features A unique and dynamic combat system - each move is also an attack The ability to individually equip *each* fighter in your army A large selection of weapons, spells and abilities, including the option to use mounted units Diverse upgrade trees, and each unit level up provides cosmetic changes An intriguing non-linear story A distinctive game world without common fantasy cliches Over 50 hours of gameplay within the game. A main campaign consisting of eight chapters plus two additional scenarios. A beautiful symphonic soundtrack in a medieval style An accompanying Scenario Editor with the full set of developer toolsIMPORTANT NOTICE: Similar to games like Disciples 2 and HOMM, there may be points farther into the game where you lose it all, troops, gold, inventory. All those things you worked so hard for. This is part of the game, not a bug. And you wont know when.... Be warned.
