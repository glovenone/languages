desc_long							评测						“Incites you to reconsider the difference between the real and virtual.”Kill Screen Daily“ULTRAWORLD boasts vibrant, fantastical environments that are sometimes difficult not to marvel at.”Game Skinny“Ultraworld is a surreal and beautiful first-person exploration adventure”PCGamer													最新更新									ULTRAWORLD EXODUS is live!  It features a redux of the original story, an entire new chapter (roughly the size of the original, a conclusion to the narrative), an expanded Vacation Mode (free exploration mode), a new album worth of music, and VR support! Now before you jump into this living abstraction, there are a few things you need to know:1 – Don't buy the game if you don't meet the minimum requirements.  Seriously, the game won't start if you don't have a DirectX11 Graphics card, a 64bit Windows OS, and 4 GB of RAM.  You have been warned!2 – To use VR you'll need to read these instructions:http://steamcommunity.com/app/331580/discussions/0/357285562492477208/And that's it, all of my warnings/asides are done.  Of course, if you're still having trouble unrelated to this, my help page still exists:  http://visit-ultraworld.com/help/Other than that, I hope you enjoy the game!James Beech, Neon Serpent LLC																						关于这款游戏							The doors to ULTRAWORLD are open and beckon you to return. Come see what's new in ULTRAWORLD EXODUS, a free addition to the wildly abstract first-person exploration adventure you've heard so much (or little) about. The sole work of James Beech, a former Crytek/Sony AAA game developer, ULTRAWORLD EXODUS is a visual novel/Art toy/who-knows-what.FEATURINGIMPERFECT: A highly revised redux of the original ULTRAWORLD story. Ponder Exoplanets and Artificial Intelligence while trying to assist a self-aware NPC in the midst of an existential crisis. Some people loved it. Some people hated it. Feel free to decide for yourself.EXODUS: A new continuation of the unusual sci-fi meta-narrative that could only be told in the medium of video games. A year has passed and ULTRAWORLD has changed. Your old pal is dismayed by your inaction, but this gives way to a new friend with an impossible plan. Embrace the hivemind!VACATION MODE: A greatly expanded free-roaming mode where you're the Artist. Change the colors, filters, particles, and rendering modes for infinite visual variety (and I do mean infinite). Then soar above the landscape, camera in hand, looking for the perfect picture. Every shot is a unique abstract painting, created by you, and fit to hang on your walls.THE SOUNDTRACK: There are now double the songs to the highly praised original soundtrack.VR SUPPORT: Vacation Mode can be setup to use VR devices (although you'll need a steel stomach. Not meant for humans)FREE: If you already own ULTRAWORLD, you'll get EXODUS automatically. It's my way of saying thanks to everyone who's supported my bizarre art experiment. And of course, anyone buying from here on out gets EXODUS as part of the package.Now get out there and find your painting!
