desc_long							评测						“Challenging, fun and extremely fair puzzle game with a great fuel mechanics and elegant level design.”8.5/10 – Colton&Zack“Should be as simple of a game as you can imagine, and if you play on the “Super Easy” difficulty, that’s the case. But when you take the jump to normal difficulty, you lose the infinite number of platform modifiers, and the game suddenly goes from casual thinker to strategic minefield.”Haogamers“The Architect is a fun little puzzler when you’re up for it. And you have to be up for it because to complete the game in the hardest difficulty, you’ll have to spend some serious time figuring out all your moves. Thumbs up for developer Spooky Star for creating one of the better puzzlers we’ve seen recently.”7.5/10 – http://3rd-strike.com/the-architect-review/												关于这款游戏							In the beginning there was nothing.
