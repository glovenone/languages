If you've not played this great indie title yet, I highly suggest you give it a go!”10/10 – Glacier Gaming“It’s peaceful, intellectually rewarding, and of all things a stress reliever. Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube, is great.”9/10 – Hooked Gamers“Qbeh-1 take’s everything that made Portal’s puzzles great and mix’s it with elements of MineCraft and even Tetris and blends them all together to create something unique yet familiar. Its Rift implementation is the best we have seen yet from a previously released 2D game so much so that it’s hard to imagine that it was not originally designed with VR in mind. Qbeh-1 is well worth your time and money as it’s a modern classic and a must play experience.”4/5 – Virtual Reality Reviewer													Level Editor & Steam Workshop																																Get Virtual!
