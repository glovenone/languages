desc_long							评测						“Essentially, Jagged Alliance Online is the Jagged Alliance you know and love and taken to the current age...”Destructoid]Destructoid[/url]													Attention!									The game was originally controlled by an online publisher and not licensed to be released as pay to play title. We did not have full control over it, so we weren't allowed to make it the way we wanted to. Now we finally got the rights to it and get rid of all the free to play crap and mindless grind. It is a better game for it.This game is NOT a remake of Jagged Alliance 2! We focus on detailed tactical combat (complete with stealth and weather conditions, recoil etc.), building up a base and your roster of mercs and operating them globally with well over 60 hours of campaign content and a unique PvP and Warzone mode to keep you busy.If you like tactical RPGs you are going to enjoy it, but if you want a faithful copy of JA2, explore other titles or go with the great JA mods that have been created by dedicated fans.																							What if I already own the Free-to-play version?									No problem! You can just continue the game at your current state - all your data has been transferred to the new servers.If you do already own the campaign pack for the free-to-play you do not need to purchase this version. We love you if you do, but you will not need it to play, we will continue to service both, though the free to play version will no longer be available from the steam store.																						关于这款游戏							Jagged Alliance Online: Reloaded brings the turn-based strategy classic back to life as a Single- and Multiplayer tactical combat game at an unbeatable price!YOUR MISSION: Survive and build  the toughest frigging merc outfit in the world!
