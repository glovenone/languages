As you get past the grunts and advance closer to the center of the terrorist cell, encounter deadlier, more skilled enemies who work together as a group to counter every move you make. 					Customizable Multiplayer Experience  - Create your own multiplayer character that evolves as you play online, unlocking new equipment and achievements as you go.
