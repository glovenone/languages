Not merely in hunting down all the endings to its many romances, but also in filling in all the pieces of its multilayered mystery. Each path will really only give you a few bits rather than the full story, and some have entire sequences you'll never see that will drastically change how you look at the story itself and other characters.”JayIsGames												关于这款游戏							Madeleine Valois is a prince's companion. Her job is to guide and advise him, to make him look good so that he can land a royal bride. It is her responsibility to keep him out of trouble - not to let him walk blindly into a political minefield, not to let him get arrested for a crime he didn't commit, and definitely not to let him fall in love with her.Unfortunately, events are not going according to plan... A visual novel of romance and royal intrigue. With the succession at stake, who can you trust? Your choice of alliances will shift the story and bring you to fifteen different possible endings.Can Madeleine break free from the social obligations that keep her trapped and helpless, or will she be led into an even more dangerous trap of royal making?
