desc_long							评测						“Ever have that nightmare where you’re falling endlessly through a surreal world of geometric shapes, nightmarish sounds and threatening shadows? Well that pretty much describes Euclidean.”The Rift Arcade“Euclidean is a very unique and strange thing. The creatures are all built from rudimentary geometric shapes, but there are pulsations and twitches to each of them that not only give them life, but make them downright unsettling.”Gamewatcher												关于这款游戏							Behind our comfortable, familiar dimensions, beyond the timeless depths of space, there is a Place that mankind was not meant to know. A Place hostile to all life. We do not belong there. We cannot survive there. At least, not for long…Euclidean; a game of geometric horror; a slow descent into the dark, into madness, futility, and despair, where Things greater than you watch and wait and dream. Struggle for every second of life you have left… Even knowing you’re better off dead.An endless faller through tense otherworldly environmentsThree difficulty levels: HARD, NIGHTMARISH and IMPOSSIBLE9 distinct stages of hand-crafted terrorTerrifying VR support Binaural 3d audio by 3Deception®Haunting ambient soundtrackNo zombies
