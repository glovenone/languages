Hatch an escape plan while you mine for the Company. Pound lasers into asteroids long enough, you might find an alien artifact and never work again. That is, if the pirates and corporate raiders don’t get there first. Their lasers are bigger, no offense, but you can upgrade, craft tools, and raid other mining camps for supplies. You do what you need to survive. Unless the AI controls you. Then all bets are off.   Your life in the 99% isn’t easy, not like the old days when there was enough for everyone. A debt slave to the Megamine Corporation, you scrape asteroids in the hope that one day you’ll find your little piece of the pie, just enough to peel off your bondage license and buy a ticket back to Deepworld. If you don’t die first.‘Cause dying is easy. Plenty of Luckless out here, poor bastards done in by ruptured oxygen lines, damaged comms, or off-kilter nav kits, the standard end-of-the-line equipment your credit chit can afford. That’s not counting the gas itself, which you extract night after night for propellant and Megamine profits. Sometimes, it propels you, deep into the everlasting darkness.Nights are all the same. Wake up in a cage somewhere outside Koops Asteroid Belt, take orders from an evil machine, pound rocks all day will lasers and, if you’re lucky, slide some home brewed Hava past the collar to unwind.It’s a lonely line of work, your friends being not so trustworthy, but there’s always the odd pirate ship to keep you company and spice up your day, even if it is your last. Megamine isn’t the only big player out here, and the gas isn’t the only treasure.Ever since Deepworld scientists confirmed the existence of microbial life somewhere in the vicinity of Eeloa, your stomping ground has gotten a whole lot more crowded. Aliens are in vogue, and finding the first signs of intelligent life have brought out the crazies. Yeah, even crazier than you.Just yesterday, the crew next door went off the reservation when their Debris Field Scanning Analyst (DFSA) identified a very strange anomaly coming from an oddly shaped asteroid. Could have been a wild goose chase, ‘cept they didn’t come back.Wake up! Megamine just tasked you with finding them. Your orders are to fly into the asteroid tunnels and see what happened.Try not to be a Luckless.
