[...] It renders the most basic concept of interaction unfamiliar by dropping the player in a world with its own rules, with its own sense of twisted dream-logic.[...] The game’s aesthetics make for some uniquely beautiful environments as well as some insightful moments of clarity about the nature of play.”70/100 – Kill Screen, by David Chandler												关于这款游戏							Genre :   Art game, Adventure, First Person Puzzler.Features :      Explore 6 surreal chapters with various and immersive environments along with crystalline guitars (including one optional chapter).     Active environmental mecanisms to solve enigmas : watch, listen, feel, discover.     The aim is to achieve the chapter called « The Choice » which requires an overall vision of the chapters. The player can enter any chapter.      Use your halo's feedback. This one may guide you. This one may disturb you.     Look carefully at disorienting and odd cutscenes which does not reveal all.      Glide sometimes through the air, walk or float.     Each chapter has a symbolic with different meanings.     The optional chapter is inspired by the Prometheus myth.Description :Cylne is a first person surreal exploration game, in the form of a visual poems collection.
