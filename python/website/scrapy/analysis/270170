Depression Quest is uncomfortable in that it feels voyeuristic, but the cramped proximity is how you develop a relationship with the character. It’s why, by the end, I was able to say I understood depression a bit better. It's a window.”Giant Bomb“[Depression Quest] is ‘game’ as communication, comfort and tool of understanding.”Rock Paper Shotgun“Besides the blues-ridden story, it's just a well-made game overall. It's excellently written, well-paced, and so engaging that you might just find yourself playing again to find out what might happen”GameSpy												关于这款游戏							Depression Quest is an interactive fiction game where you play as someone living with depression.
