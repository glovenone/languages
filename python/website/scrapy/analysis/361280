desc_long							评测						“As simple as it looks and is to control, there’s a fair bit going on in Turmoil. Its got its hooks in me.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun“Turmoil is the epitome of simplicity. It is more about betting against oneself when drilling, playing an extremely simple market, and exploiting upgrades for the most gain”4/5 – Hardcore gamer“Turmoil makes for some of the best fun and strategic game-play in this oil tycoon game.”9/10 – Fragged Nation													最新更新									So long, Early Access!After almost exactly 1 year, we just hit the 'Leave early Access' button. It has been a great experience for us, and we want to thank all the players for their trust, ideas, and feedback. Turmoil would have been half as good without it.Leaving Early Access does not mean we will stop working on the game. It does mean that we will do that in a lower frequency. This gives us time to start on a new game, which we're itching to do. Turmoil will however still get updates like Mac support, more single game options (Steam Leaderboards), more languages, extra polish, and who knows what else. We may have left Early Access, we're still open to suggestions from the community.We'll stop rambling and let you play Turmoil again. We've noticed that your level of play is not quite up to our standards. The Oil Tycoon achievement is actually doable. :wink:																						关于这款游戏							Turmoil offers players a visually charming, tongue-in-cheek take on the simulation genre inspired by the 19th century oil rush in North America.
