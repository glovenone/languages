I can’t count the number of time I barely made it through a wave, and the sense of accomplishment I had afterward was always great.”3.9/5 – Mash Those Buttons“Drive to Hell is a simple yet challenging game that can be enjoyed in either short or long bursts, Ghost Crab Games, the developers have clearly drawn inspiration from older titles like Outrun and Spy Hunter while at the same time adding new features and more reasons to keep you coming back time and time again. If you enjoy this sort of arcade non-stop action, then your epic quest to avenge the destruction of your favorite bar (yep, that's the plot) will be a fun one.”No Review Left Behind“Drive to Hell is a breath of fresh air, defying convention while also building on a solid foundation to deliver an excellent indie arcade experience. It has unique enemies from the titular underworld, a bounty of bonuses to collect, and a soundtrack that wont leave your head for months. These are the types of games which you just don’t see often in the current age of mobile ports and Greenlight disasters, and that alone should warrant your attention.”Geekenstein												关于这款游戏							Drive to Hell is an action-packed shooter where you'll take a ride through an army of monsters to exact revenge on the Demon King for destroying your favorite dive bar.
