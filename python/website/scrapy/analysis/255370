Experiment with different types of music to create different types of fights!We got rid of the bars, arrows, button icons, etc. that other music games rely on as action cues and replaced them with fully 3D animated characters.  Instead of just seeing characters in the background moving to a preset script as eye candy while the actual gameplay takes place in an abstract 2D interface, you actually control and react to those 3D characters.  That means you actually get to focus your attention on what those characters are doing! As you play the game, you're creating your own fight sequence with your button presses. We also let you get rid of all the other interface parts (such as score) if you like, so that there are no distractions from the action.KickBeat features a full length single player campaign with beautifully hand drawn animations and a unique art style.Media Quotes“KickBeat succeeds as both a rhythm game and a fighting one” – JoyStiq“Combining slick combat with finely tuned rhythm-action fare, KickBeat was so frenetic it even managed to stir me from my early-morning half-awake sate.” – Pocket Gamer“The hand-drawn animation really stands out in this regard and I found myself getting absorbed by the hypnotic flow of the figures moving in and out of the combat area.” – Destructoid
