desc_long							评测						“The world of Ether One is a superbly detailed and well thought-out place.”4/5 – Joystiq“It’s been just two days since I last player Ether One and I’ve not stopped thinking about it since. I thought about it before I went to bed last night, and the night before. I thought about it when I woke up this morning. I thought about it when I had lunch. So far I’ve sunk 12 hours into a game easily completable in four. I’ve not nearly managed to restore all of the projectors. And I've hardly scratched the surface.”9/10 – Strategy Informer“Superb: A hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage to what is a supreme title.”9/10 – Destructoid												关于这款游戏							Ether One is a first person adventure that deals with the fragility of the human mind.
