The game has a real ‘just one more turn’ vibe.”8/10 – Gamespot“Much more intelligent and tactical than your average tower defence affair”8/10 – GameWatcher“Space Run Galaxy is so, SO much more than just a tower defence game”8/10 – Game Spew													Twitch Dev Session									Watch the Replay																						关于这款游戏							Space Run Galaxy is the sequel to Space Run, the game from one-man studio Passtech, which seduced hundreds of thousands of players with its dynamic and original gameplay.

Space Run Galaxy offers limitless gameplay, while fresh new features expand the original experience:User-created contracts – Take on contracts from other players for better rewards and unlimited replayability.Intergalactic player market – Trade hard-earned goods with your fellow space runners to sell off extra supplies, or snap up a tidy bargain.New corporations offer riskier jobs – Carry the extra fragile cargo of XenoPrime, or risk transporting The Force’s highly dangerous weapon prototypes (which may even endanger your own ship!) Fresh dangers await – Face off against brand new boss-type enemies, such as deadly pirate ships and huge space monsters…Deep customization – Customize the shape and size of any ships you acquire during your adventure. There’s no restriction for what ship you use in each mission, letting you get creative with every run!
