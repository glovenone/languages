desc_long								关于这款游戏							Andromedum is a VR novel with stereoscopic environments and audio narration.HTC Vive motion controllers are required!Jack Philips is running, and he can’t even remember why.Hunted through the remnants of a world where our past exists only as fractured clues, Jack has almost as little information about his identity. Only a sword too fine for any common soldier and flashes of memory telling him things that would get anyone else in the kingdom executed.The kingdom itself is a mystery, its king determined to maintain that mystery by any means necessary. Knowledge is horded, the majority of the kingdom reduced to living in a world of swords and horses, kings and petty wars. Around them, steel and glass stand as half-remembered snatches of the past, but for most people they point to truths they will never be permitted to grasp.When Jack meets Henry and Dahlia, a father and daughter dedicated to the preservation of the past, his simple sprint for the edges of the kingdom turns into something more complex. Henry wants to save as much as he can of what came before the kingdom. Dahlia simply wants to tear the kingdom down.Ultimately, Jack must decide whether to keep on running, or finally make a stand for the world as it should be. Either way, the hunters are still coming. He might not remember them, but they definitely remember him.
