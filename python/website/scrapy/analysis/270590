All of a sudden everyone is on his own. During the night David will try to find and help his friends, but doing so, he will have to face worse than the fear that pursues him.Features:- Take control of your environment, keep the balance of your mental state to run and hide from your nemesis - Resolve enigma to understand the intimacy of the 4 teenagers and become the wall between them and their fears. - Explore Long Night camp to discover great side quests, giving better understanding of the background.- Choose to play with Old School (without checkpoints and interaction icons) or Modern Gameplay (with all the help you want)Warning:Long Night is rated 17+ M for mature by ESRB for the following contentViolenceBloodSexual ThemesNudity
