He has Sunday dinner every Sunday with his sister, Susannah, in their late parents' home.When he doesn't show up for dinner one Sunday, or for work the next day, the local authorities assume that he's fallen off the wagon. Susannah is unconvinced, and manages to convince their estranged brother, Nate, to return from a self-imposed exile in Colorado to help her search for Eli. What they begin to find suggests something strange, and possibly extraterrestrial, may be occurring in Musgrove.**********From[bracket]games, creator of Three Fourths Home, To Azimuth casts players as Nate or Susannah in two interconnected stories that follow their pursuit for the truth.
