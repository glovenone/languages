desc_long								关于这款游戏							Majestic Nights is an episodic action-adventure-thriller set in an alternate 1980s where all conspiracy theories, past and present, are True. You play as Cardholder: an intelligence operative who may or may not have been present at or even responsible for many of the biggest conspiracy events in history; and Cal, a humble Private Investigator whose own past is shrouded in secrets unknown even to herself. With fast, light mechanics, the game has been developed to engross players in a shadowy world of conspiracy with an over-the-top 1980s aesthetic. Players will use wits, stealth and sometimes even a little force to investigate, explore, and acquire ever more clues for their big string-covered wall of conspiracies. Season One of Majestic Nights takes place over six chapters, which work as a complete story or as standalone experiences. ‘Chapter Zero’, a prologue to the series, will be made available for free. Each subsequent chapter of the core series will be paid, and season passes will also be available.Feature ListIsometric Action Adventure GameplayReal-time stealth and combat mechanicsInvestigate and collect evidence to reveal the TruthBig hair!A vibrant alternative 1980s settingA world full of conspiracy theories and government plots where everything you know is wrongController support for platforms including PC, MacNazi aliens!A gripping, six episode storyAlternate story paths to explorePuzzles, minigames and more!Kick-ass original 1980s soundtrack‘Chapter Zero’, a prologue to the core season, will be available free before launchMore Truth than any other game!Season Pass will be available on all platforms (and comes with the soundtrack!)Steam AchievementsKeytars
