At the beginning, you need to share your secret desire to become one of the seafood.Take control of an array of sea creatures and freely explore the ocean in an open-world map. You will engage in battle with various forms of sea-life in order to capture and take control of the reefs they guard. The reefs serve as bases from which you can strengthen your allies and breed more of them.  As you multiply your victories, you will be able to control a stronger force and explore a wider region.In battle, your allies will follow the commands of the Ace (that's you) which include battle formation and special abilities.

Admire the underground tunnels dug out by the shrimp. Discover the monsters that lurk in the deep, and the creatures which can light up the darkest parts of the ocean!Why, even I could not create such amazing creatures in my mind....So instead, let me be the one to tell you of their legacy.This is the epic tale of the champion of an ocean world.And epic tales are known to have a bit of exaggeration...
