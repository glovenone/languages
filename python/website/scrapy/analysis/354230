desc_long							评测						“If you’re stirring up a fictional war for a video game, I’d be far more interested in unknowable celestial entities weaponising the very cosmos, devouring and merging stars to create colossal murdertools.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun“A minimalist RTS, but one that doesn't lack for depth of strategy.”IndieGames“A remarkable strategy game. The versatility and openness of the game is quite a plus factor for players who are into heavy strategic gaming that is more on action and without the intrinsic unit management.”SirusGaming												关于这款游戏							There are so many games set in space, willingly limiting their scope to new instances of Star Wars-style ships, blasters and myths. Devouring Stars is an attempt at expanding the horizon of "celestial" games, focusing on the eerie beauty and poetry of distant stars, blackholes and mysterious corners of our universe.What if you could litterally unhook the stars? What if you could be a galactic-sized entity?In Devouring Stars you play a tribe of godlike entities trapped in Tartarus, a corner of the universe as far beneath hell as heaven is high above the earth. Hunted by 4 other tribes, you have been given the ability to draw your own fate. But to what extent?Devouring Stars uses a couple of unique mechanics to create a different experience on the RTS and space exploration genre. Your entities have the ability to "devour" starfields, creating dynamic nebulas that will protect them. There's no tech tree or building facilities in Devouring Stars: your entities are able to merge in order to create advanced units with special abilities. Depending on the set of entities you start the game with, you will be able to go for different strategies that will evolve during the game.Devouring Stars is mainly inspired by Dan Simmons' Illium but also by games like Homeworld, Eufloria, Starcraft or Faster Than Light.FEATURES15 advanced entities to unlock by merging the 4 basic ones (earth, air, fire, water). Each advanced unit has a specific ability like freezing enemies, controling them, attacking them from afar...Generated starfields offering a wide range of beautiful and differently balanced layoutsThousands of different settings through generated scenariosDirect attack, escape route, diversion... many ways to go through the game depending on your strategic choices, your entities and your enemies4 enemy tribes with specific features and behaviorsUnique particule system able to display thousands of dynamic starsAnd some well hidden secrets...
