desc_long								关于这款游戏							A.I.M. Racing welcomes you to the planet Polygon-4, where deadly vehicles of the distant future compete, swishing planet’s dusty atmosphere at a tremendous pace. Years ago humans along with the Arlings used Polygon-4 for a number of military experiments, but later left the test complex. However, the intelligent machines, AIMs, continue to fulfill objectives they are programmed for: further evolution and self-perfection. AIMs of the Reckoners clan built a network of tracks to test multi-purpose combat machines in action.					If you are not afraid of awesome speed, fatal traps and plasma charges, tearing apart your racing glider’s sheeting, A.I.M. Racing is a game of your choice. There is no need to save money to buy a new glider, no need to think, where you can acquire energy supply for a more powerful canon. The clan will give you everything – but you must win!					Over 50 rounds in a Championship					Over 30 various gliders					Diverse tactic to destroy your opponents					Unique glider dynamics					Treacherous traps and useful bonuses.					Vast number of weaponry, including mines and rockets					Detailed statistics for each race to show your skills					Online records table					Multiplayer options
