No in-game transactions, no ads – just plenty of button-mashing fun to be had.”8.2 – IGN Middle East												关于这款游戏							Curse of Mermos features Abdu, an adventurer searching for fame and fortune in the ruins of Ancient Egypt. One of the greatest mysteries still standing is the location of Pharaoh Ebo, once a great ruler of the land.

Curse of Mermos is a free, lighthearted hack and slash game with fast paced action and challenging combat.
