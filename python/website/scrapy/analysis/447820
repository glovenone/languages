desc_long								关于这款游戏							Experience intense close-quarters WWII infantry combat, from the entrenched shores to the battered streets in Day of Infamy. What started out as an Insurgency mod has transformed into a full-fledged standalone game built with Source Engine.Gameplay FeaturesGritty Objective-Based ExperienceIntense core infantry mechanics and a simplified HUD create a highly visceral and immersive experience. With a reinforcement wave system tied to objectives, the game maintains an emphasis on teamwork and coordination.Squad-Based Role SystemSquad system built upon role-based player classes, which are asymmetrical based on what team you are on. Depending on your supply points, you may customize and upgrade your gear, affecting your appearance, weight, stamina, and movement speed.Strategic Leadership and Artillery StrikesOfficers can direct their team in the field. In addition to a wide variety of command options, they may call in an intense artillery barrage on the enemy, if a radio operator is nearby.Local and Radio CommunicationsLocal VOIP is used to talk to your teammates in the game, but be careful because the enemy can hear you if you’re close enough. Radio operators also serve as a communication beacon to those around them, as HQ and radio operator chatter can be heard through them.NostalgiaThe game aims to be a continuation of the gritty WWII experience established by the Day of Defeat mod for Half-Life in 2001. It builds off the atmosphere and nostalgia of this classic experience, but adds more visceral and intense core infantry mechanics.Currently Playable Content3 Multiplayer game modesDesigned for up to 32 players engaging in sustained infantry combat, battling over territorial and destructive objectives that increase your reinforcements.3 Cooperative game modes8 player squads battle a challenging AI opponent in attack or defense modes.3 FactionsThe Allied infantry forces of the British Commonwealth and U.S. Army clash against the German Wehrmacht. Combined-faction gameplay allow the Brits and Americans to fight together on the battlefield.6 mapsFrom the shores of Sicily and streets of Italy, to the forests of Belgium and Germany. And of course the Normandy beaches.20 weapons and wide range of attachmentsFull-range arsenal including bolt-action rifles, pistols, revolvers, submachine guns, heavy machine guns, grenades, and flamethrowers. Fix bayonets, extend magazines, or swap iron sights with period-specific customization options.Community FeaturesWorkshop SupportDay of Infamy first emerged as the most popular Workshop mod for Insurgency, with over 175,000 subscribers. With Workshop support you can expect to see custom weapons, player skins, maps, and various other mods created by our talented community.Development GoalsThroughout Early Access NWI plans to expand content and features up until the full release. While the below details are subject to change, they outline NWI’s current goals when it comes to finalizing the game experience.Level DesignOne of the main goals we plan to focus on during early access is making each level as fun and visually impressive as possible. The implemented maps are intentionally bare of details for the early access launch, so they will be modified based upon feedback more easily.Character, Weapon and Faction DiversityCanadians, Indians, Italians, Black-Americans, Japanese-Americans, US paratroopers, German paratroopers, British Commandos. All new factions will have corresponding characters, arsenals and voice acting.New Game ModesWhen factions such as commandos and paratroopers are introduced, there will be new associated multiplayer and cooperative game modes introduced along with them.New MapsWhile we have a few new environments in mind, we are eager to see what the community creates in the form of custom maps for the game during early access. We may very well include community-created maps in the final release of the game.Polished VisualsWe aim to replace any placeholder content with highly polished artwork by the time the game ships.RankingsPlayers will eventually be able to track their personal statistics and game mode rankings amongst other players.Linux SupportLinux and SteamOS will be supported eventually. We are aiming for later in the year, 2016.Community RequestsSimilar to our methods with Insurgency’s Early Access, we strive to allow our community’s help to shape this game. We keep our ears open for community feedback and ideas to ensure the best ideas are considered when they fulfill our design goals for the game.
