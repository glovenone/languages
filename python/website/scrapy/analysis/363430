The game is intended for PC Computers featuring a force feedback steering wheel and pedal system but works with any style of controller. The title features 5 different vehicles and 6 large open world maps with more than 50 Miles of trails, two tracks and racing courses to explore. The main focus is capturing the intensity of off road driving and trying to give drivers the idea of what its like to harness the big power of these off road machines.
