Strategies must be divined with care, and constantly modified to ride the chaotic rapids of the thousands of interactive elements in this opus of creative genius. Perhaps. Or it could just be a damn fine game.”95 – Amiga Format“Colonization offers hours and hours of entertainment. I played it for over a week to write this review and it commanded my total concentration all the time to play it once through. Because the game can be very different every time you play it, this means that Colonization is the sort of game you could play for ever.”93 – Amiga Power“"Go and make a world", they said. "Do it by Wednesday night", they said. "And bring us back some chips". Colonization is a fairly simple idea in theory but, thankfully, much more involved once you get going. Set sail in your little ship, bump into a bit of land that rightfully belongs to someone else, then claim it as your own. Ah, the American way...”91 – CU Amiga												关于这款游戏							The Tradition of Civilization ContinuesThe New World lies before you with all its peril, promise and infinite possibility.
