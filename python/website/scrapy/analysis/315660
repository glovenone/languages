desc_long								关于这款游戏							Massive Update just released (Jan 2016)!Trainz: A New Era has just received a massive update - after more than six months development, and many thousands of hours Beta Testing by our core Trainz community, the new "Service Pack 1" update delivers improved performance and stability and plenty of bug fixes and enhancements across the board. Trainz: A New Era completely revamps the Trainz series, and takes the train simulation genre to new heights. The all-new graphics engine brings historic and modern routes to life in eye-watering realism. Operate famous locomotives, explore fascinating routes and unleash your creative side designing and building your own routes and Driver Sessions!Trainz: A New Era provides train-fans with hundreds of hours gameplay in single and multiplayer as well as countless hours creating your own rail masterpiece using the world-renowned "Surveyor" editing tools.Share and enjoy your creations with our huge community or use the Download Station to access 250.000+ DLC items created by other Trainz fans worldwide.Key FeaturesAll-new graphics engine with full world shadows and per-pixel lightingMultiplayer Share your enthusiasm with other rail fans and combine your efforts with others to operate a working rail line!Our most accurate simulation yet with real time world physics and editing tools!Calculated at 30 times a second, our physics use a variety of configurable inputs such as engine powers, train weight and rolling resistance whilst taking into account factors like track gradient, curve resistance and track adhesion for each train car when accelerating or decelerating. The brand new real time physics editing tools allow players to tune physics 'on-the-fly' to take their simulation's performance even further.Brand-new Real-time Physics Editing tools enable users to enter known specifications to accurately monitor all the forces at work. Things like tractive effort, drawbar pull or brake pipe pressure can be monitored at a specific point along the train and input values adjusted "on-the-fly". By analysing and tuning performance without leaving the simulation, real-world train characteristics can be matched perfectly. (It's a bit like running a virtual dynamometer car).If physics aren't your thing, don't worry. You can leave the fine-tuning of your favourite locomotive's performance to the experts whilst still having the choice between 'Realistic Mode' or 'Easy Mode' driving options.Procedurally animated spline junctionsAn updated set of track laying tools are provided in Surveyor to automatically adds frogs/vee, blades, and checkrails in the correct place on the tracks when making a switch, turnout or junction. The blades then animate as the junction direction is changed.Realistic cab sway and external train motionUsing a new suspension modelling system and additional track and traincar parameters, cab sway and "car rocking" from both internal and external perspective provide more realistic train motion visuals. When running on rough track, cars will wobble and shake independently.Smoke and weather affected by world objectsNew particle effects and collision systems will prevent rain penetrating a tunnel, smoke will billow out from the underside of a bridge or the top of a tunnel and all particle effects will change velocity, direction and flow more naturally.Tons of Extra ContentAccess to over 250,000+ free DLC items via The Download StationIn-game downloadable content system for both payware and freeware optionsCreate your own routes with powerful in-game level editing toolsConfigurable control schemesOur most expansive soundtrack yetNever lose your way with the in-game navigation systemOpen multiple windows to view and compare items in Preview Mode while creating your world in another windowIncl. 250 page digital user manual - a digital PDF providing detailed information on every aspect of TrainzBrand new Routes and SessionsTrainz: A New Era provides a variety of high quality routes - both built-in to the core edition or available as Downloadable Content. Kickstarter CountyBased upon the famous Highland Valley route from the early days of Trainz, Kickstarter County has received a huge upgrade with new content, new track, new industries, and new high definition assets.Chesapeake & Ohio RR, Hinton Division - (United States, 1950)Hinton Division, one of the major coal producing areas for the C&O, starts just west of Thurmond, WV through to Hinton, WV and includes 4 subdivisions. Laurel Creek, Piney Creek, Rend, and Loup Creek.ECML Kings Cross - Edinburgh (UK, 1976)This edition delivers the full route from London Kings Cross Station all the way to Edinburgh in Scotland - a 393 mile drive! With significant updates to almost every feature, this route will transport you back in time to 1976.Healesville - (Australia, 1910's)A faithful recreation of the towns, stations, bridges and rural countryside of 1915 Australia. The line includes several notable features, including the 1.6 mile long timber trestle bridge over the Yarra River and flood plains between Yering and Yarra Glen and one of the very few tunnels on the Victorian Railways.Avery - Drexel - (United States, 1970's) - Deluxe EditionThe Milwaukee Road route runs from the end of the electrification in Avery, across the Bitterroot Mountains via the St Paul Pass, and through to the crew-change point in Alberton. It features Little Joe EF4 electrics and a huge range of seasonal rolling stock.Warwick to Wallangarra - (Australia 1990's) - Deluxe EditionFollow the QR Southern railway line through the Darling Downs and into Granite country, right to the border with New South Wales.Season Town Northern Rail Road – (East or Middle West USA) - Deluxe EditionThe Season Town Northern Rail Road (STNRR) is based in fictional 'Season Town' situated somewhere in the East or Middle West of the USA. The aptly named Season Town supports season change functionality. Control the weather and see how the route responds to the snow! The layout provides a short mainline section as well as a 6 mile branch line connecting a limestone mine with a cement plant, as well as a streetcar network consisting of four branches.The BiDye Traction Railroad – (Someone's Garage) - Deluxe EditionThe BiDye Traction Railroad shows off the versatility of Trainz: A New Era by creating a virtual model railroad for you to explore. Built in a large virtual garage in much less time and a fraction of the costs of a traditional model railroad, BiDye highlights how Trainz can be used by model train fans as well as prototypical fans alike. Set up as a short line electric traction railroad serving several inter-dependent industries, the industries served by the railroad include lumber mill, furniture factory, grain mill, commercial bakery, paint and solvent factory, metal can and container factory, and a coal fired electricity plant.
