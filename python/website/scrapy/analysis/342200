desc_long								关于这款游戏							MechWarrior Online™MechWarrior Online™ is a tactical, 'Mech-based online shooter set in the rich BattleTech Universe. The battlefields of the 31st century are dominated by immense and powerful mechanized units known as BattleMechs. Piloting these war machines are the most elite soldiers that the galaxy has ever known. To most, they are known simply as MechWarriors. You will assume the role of an elite MechWarrior, fighting for supremacy over the galaxy against other players.Quick Play is where you'll find fast action, fielding a single 'Mech in team-based game modes and maps. Unlike Faction Play, Quick Play matches do not influence the layout of Inner Sphere territories; these battles are fought purely for rewards and glory.In Faction Play you will field 4 ‘Mechs per match, lending your skills and allegiance to the Faction of your choosing in prolonged team-based engagements, conquering and defending planets in their name to earn rewards and expand your Faction's territory across the Inner Sphere.GameplayPiloting a 'Mech to victory requires a mastery of tactical positioning, teamwork, and firing discipline. Strike out as a Lone Wolf or seek out one of the many player-controlled Units and fight under the banners of powerful galactic empires for prestige, wealth, or nothing more than the sheer thrill of battle. Next Gen Mobility - By the 31st century, tanks have evolved to take on humanoid shape, their treads replaced with nimble legs. Like modern tanks, 'Mechs move their upper torso and weapons independently of their legs offering unparalleled mobility while exchanging fire. Depending on their size, BattleMechs travel at vastly different speeds and offer different systems like jump jets to aid in their locomotion.Make Every Shot Count - Pilots must balance mobility and damage output against the amount of heat generated from their weapons fire and 'Mech operation, lest they risk the temporary loss of power that comes when a 'Mech overheats. Firing all weapons simultaneously (known as an Alpha Strike) can be the quickest way to devastate an opponent, but may leave a 'Mech helpless against its enemies if the heat sinks can't handle the stress.Fight Smart - 'Mechs possess both external armor and strong internal structural elements to help minimize the chance of a 'quick kill'. As a result, pilots must treat each encounter with the utmost attention and awareness, prioritizing weaker or more critical components before delivering the killing blow. Communication among teammates and the effective use of targeting systems can help to identify vulnerable 'Mechs and components.Teamwork is the Difference - Targeting a 'Mech will automatically allow your teammates to achieve their own lock, allowing them to ascertain vital location data, armor status, and loadout details for the targeted enemy. Information Warfare can be a vital component for victory, providing attack-focused allies with the necessary information to tear their opponents to pieces.Information Warfare - While fast-moving scouts feed target and tactical information back to the main battle group and the team commander, long-range Support and heavy-hitting Brawler and Assault ‘Mechs will use this information to position themselves for the perfect strike. Pilots can also shield themselves and allies from enemy sensors and weapons fire using various counter measures. It is up to each pilot to customize their BattleMech loadout to fulfill their desired role. Find the perfect 'Mech - Hundreds of unique 'Mechs are available, offering a wide range of strengths and weaknesses. Smaller 'Mechs should never stop moving, and can rely on their sheer speed to overwhelm heavier opponents. Larger 'Mechs move slow and deliberate but can stand toe-to-toe with other large opponents. Acquire and test different 'Mechs to find those that best suit your play style.Choose Your Allegiance - Work for the powerful empires of the galaxy to earn their loyalty and spread their influence across the stars. Band together with other pilots using the Looking For Group feature, or use the Faction Chat feature to coordinate offensive and defensive strategies to capture or defend worlds and shift the balance of power.Get Rewarded - Pilots earn ComStar Bills (C-Bills) from playing matches and completing faction contracts, which can be used to purchase new 'Mechs and equipment.Certain items can only be purchased using premium 'Mech Credits (MC). MC can either be purchased directly via real world money or acquired in smaller increments in-game by earning reputation with a Faction in Faction Play, or as rewards from participating in special Events.'Mech Experience (XP) gained during combat is applied to the 'Mech used during that match, and can be used to unlock improvements to various BattleMech systems.MechWarrior Online™ also includes a host of achievements to unlock that will challenge even the most skilled players.
