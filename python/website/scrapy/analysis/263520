That light was well worth my time with it, and the personal, raw story of the two women woven into the narrative was something I couldn’t turn away from.”IndieGameMag“Enola brings a wildly imaginative psychological horror game to players. Although its held back by technical and narrative limitations, the core game is one horror fans should look into.”Hardcore Gamer“There are definitely some VERY dark topics that are brought up through the game, so you better be secure in dealing with uncomfortable situations or topics that befall a girl as she is growing up.”Altered Confusion												关于这款游戏							Enola is a psychological adventure game that delves into the inherent darkness of love, death and revenge.
