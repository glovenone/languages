desc_long								关于这款游戏							All creatures of ancient myth, legend and lore are real  they've just been sealed away for thousands of years inside Pandora's Box, waiting...                    					When a thief named Deckard is hired to steal an ancient artifact, he unwittingly triggers a war between man and myth.                    					Griffons rule the skies, Werewolves tear the innocent limb from limb and cities are held under siege as creatures we'd dismissed as imaginings of our ancestors prove to be very real and very angry for being held prisoner for untold millennia.                    					As the only person able to return these creatures to the box, Deckard finds that he must work with a shadowy secret society to save civilization before it is torn apart by tooth and claw.                    					A mythical first person shooter set in an unprepared, modern world.                    					A massive blockbuster movie experience  society collapses around you as man and machine take on beasts of legend in spectacular battle.                    					Awe-inspiring fire-fights where high caliber ordinance meets beak, talon, fang and claw.                    					Dynamic environments crumble around you as you and your enemies tear a living, breathing environment apart in your battle to stay alive.                    					Devastation realized on an unprecedented scale.  See London burn to the ground and witness New York torn apart through spectacular supernatural destruction.                    					The enemy of your enemy is your enemy  witness and take part in three way battles as you combat the supernatural as well as the militant arm of an age old clandestine organization who prove to be a formidable opponent and adequate prey for the armies of mythical beasts.
