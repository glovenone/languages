Steady balance of in car and on foot gameplay with explosive graphics. If you're an action fan, your money has probably grown dusty, it's time to brush it off.”90 – Gaming Entertainment Monthly“Overall, I find the game quite enjoyable. While I believe it would have profited from things like bodywork damage and better strafing, it’s perfectly playable nonetheless, and is definitely worth checking out.”88 – Game Over Online												关于这款游戏							Join the Company!It's 2066 and the world is a different place.
