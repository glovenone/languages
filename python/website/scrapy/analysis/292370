desc_long							评测						“Overall between the various gameplay elements, the well told story, and sometimes quite awesome character dialog (love Griselda), DarkEnd is well worth the time for anyone who appreciates a harder RPG or even Roguelikes as they will feel at home.”8.5/10 – Chalgyr's Game Room“The best feature and the main selling point in my opinion are the random dungeons. I would imagine the actual “DarkEnd” that corrupted the world to be much like the calamity in Bastion, where the world changes and collapses, contorting and rebuilding itself, at least that is what I get from the constantly changing dungeons.”7.5/10 – Modvive“All in all, we quite enjoyed this particular outing, and would happily recommend it!”8/10 – TheDRASTIKmeasure												关于这款游戏							Can you conquer the ever changing dungeons of DarkEnd and save the fall of humanity?
