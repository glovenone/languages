Tricone Lab stands out ... even on a relatively simple premise provides both a lot of playability and for a lot of challenges, even for puzzle veterans.”4/5 – Nouse												关于这款游戏							A game of cellular logicThe aim of each puzzle level is to create molecules of a mysterious multicoloured substance: tricone. To solve each level, you must interact with the components and structure of a strange micro-organism. For example, you will often use catalysts to combine basic resource nodes into useful compounds. Or sometimes, you will break apart compounds to release their resources. You must change the cell structure, sometimes breaking open cell walls, at other times creating new divisions within a cell. Each level can only be solved by figuring out the right sequence of interactions. As you progress, different elements are introduced, creating more difficult logic puzzles and requiring you to think outside the cell.Features A total of 100 puzzle levels ship with the game A wealth of different cell elements which all interact with each other A series of guided tutorial levels for each element, before you're plunged into the harder puzzle levels Key-based progression -- as you learn how more elements work, levels which use these elements become unlocked Non-linear -- some puzzles can be skipped if you are finding them too tough Full undo / redo capability while solving puzzles Graphical level editor to make your own puzzles.
