desc_long								关于这款游戏							You find yourself stuck outside of a small hut, in a severe snow storm. You can see a car, probably yours, stranded nearby, half covered in snow. As you look around for ways to get inside the house, your body gets colder, your limbs freeze up, and the storm intensifies. Your challenge is to find and combine several items lying around the building to gain entry.
