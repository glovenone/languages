It’s like… it’s like they’re talking directly to me.”Rock Paper Shotgun“It's easy to imagine that Supraball represents one possible future of eSports competition.”PC Gamer												关于这款游戏							Instead of writing more about why we think this game is great we decided to let our beta testing community write some comments here.What is Supraball? - imagine you're playing fifa, controlling just one player. Okay now imagine that each other player is a real person. Okay now imagine you're in first person, and you have this super awesome cannon with dozens of combinations of spins that fires a yellow ball at 400km/h. Okay now imagine you've fired that into the top corner at that speed - and someone saves it. That is supraball!Solomon"So the first thing that I liked was the innovation, there are no games like it."Malaria"The game being a first person sports game made me feel like I was actually on the field playing ball. Also, the fact that everyone on the playing field was an actual person, and not a scripted AI that would change into the player if given the ball, added an element I personally had never seen in a game before Supraball."Skel"F**k yes, I can play football at home!"Silw"The thing that fascinated me the most is the amount of teamwork involved and the kind of creativity you can have while playing this game."Bakes"It's pretty easy to play but hard to master."Olo"Most fascinating is the ability some players have to always create new moves etc."Goku"Different things happen every match, so it's never the same."Dimle"I liked being the last hope for my team and the tense pressure filled moments were amazing. Making a 1v1 save is a really awesome feeling and no other game has given me the same feeling yet."Vendetta"Very precise, accurate, total control. Intense gameplay, nail biting finishes.I can't stop, it's heroin/crack!"Revan
