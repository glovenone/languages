Few of us survived, we are trapped on this frozen, hellish planet. With every hour more and more of those alien scums are circling around our shelter. I don't know how long we can hold them back, but we won't go down cheaply. I never was a religious man, but if any god can hear me on this distant world and for some reasons decides to ignore my prayers, then after this shipwreck turn into my frozen grave, I will spit in his face.Main features:- Manage group of survivors, each of them will provide unique bonuses! - Upgrade your base.
