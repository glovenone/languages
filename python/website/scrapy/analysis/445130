She's hungry. Okay, she's past hungry. She's at whatever stage is right after hungry. It's not that she doesn't have food, she has a box of oatmeal just sitting on her shelf waiting for her consumption. Thing is, she needs some help. Your help specifically and well, helping Sam isn't always easy.Key FeaturesOriginal artwork and animations by illustrator and comic book artist, Reimena Yee Dynamic soundtrack by Adrianna Krikl Player decisions impact the outcome of the game in unexpected ways Oatmeal not includedFind the right words to help Samantha or suffer the consequences.
