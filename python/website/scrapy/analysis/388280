Captured photos can be displayed on your computer using the built-in Snapshot Viewer, or choose your preferred photo viewing app, e.g. Photoshop.You can also export a 'snapshot' of your camera's current settings which you can later apply back to your camera quickly and easily.Import camera settings from digital photographs by extracting the settings (ISO, F Stop, Exposure Time, etc) that were used when the photograph was taken, and set up your camera in exactly the same way.
