Simply put, a diorama is a painting you can visit with a simple goal of inspiring a sense of wonder. They are an ideal retreat to think and be somewhere else. In 'Blocked In' you will visit the workspace of a Russian scientist to enjoy an extraordinary view of the end of the world by tetronimoes, that will leave you ‘Blocked In’.Blocked In is the first entry in 'The Shoebox Diorama', an ongoing series of fantastical dioramas for VR devices by interactive illustrator 'Daniel Ernst'. A diorama can be explored as a standalone experience or as an interconnected experience through the ‘Table of Contents’ diorama (coming soon), which serves as the central hub.'Blocked In' was first released in late 2013 for the DK1. For many early adopters ‘Blocked In’ was their first introduction to VR and has been one of the defining VR experiences. It also coined the term diorama for these types of VR experiences.If you liked ‘Blocked In’ why not try other dioramas as well :  http://store.steampowered.com/app/431370
