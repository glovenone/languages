desc_long							评测						“This is the kind of game that interrupts gameplay with actual footage of people calling it garbage. The kind that aspires to be viewed as "shovelware." The kind that claims to be "the unlicensed Bible game that should have been buried in the desert." The kind about space nuns saving orbital monasteries, featuring narration by no-wave godhead Jarboe. Uriel's Chasm, in other words, is the kind of game you should play immediately.”Kill screen daily“Those who appreciate indie games, particularly ones that push boundaries of what is acceptable for games, should pursue this. Uriel’s Chasm is an uncomfortable, avant-garde title that has hooked me. Chances are more unsuspecting players will continue to fall under its strange spell.”Hardcore gamer“Uriel's Chasm is an acquired taste, but something tells me this could find it's way to reaching cult classic status one day.”Modvive												关于这款游戏							"Sister Tabitha has been asleep 8 years. On route to investigate the disappearance of the orbital Monastery "Enoch's Hope"; She is haunted by reoccurring dreams of a Dimethyltryptamine harvesting "Garden of paradise"."At least that's what the box said to the obscure avante garde 90's game the "Shovelware Queens" started reviewing. The Unlicensed Bible game that should have been buried in a desert is back !! and this time its taking no prisoners on its metaphysical "psychosis quest" into the very nature of God and death.Featuring :-- Voice over By award winning SWANS no-wave high priestess Jarboe- Ancient Hebrew story telling techniques of Allegory and Typology.- Rich Context that infinitely rewards further investigation.- Gamestyles including a complete re-imagining of Asteroids, High octane "Ghett-ro" Euroshmup action and "Non-Game" meta weirdness.- Metaphysics drawn from over 7 years of research.- Pulsing keytar soundtrack by Dylan Barry (Super killer hornet Resurrection, NPPD RUSH, Psichodelya)
