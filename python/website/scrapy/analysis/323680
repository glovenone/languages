If you take the time to play around with some of the settings until you actually get the game working it is definitely worth playing. I loved the idea of this since I saw the first trailer, and I definitely wouldn’t say that I’m disappointed.”8/10 – Complete Game Reviews													Caffeine - The First DirectX 12 Game!
