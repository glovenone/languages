I’m going to stop writing this review so that I can play more.”Kill Screen													最新更新									Woah Dave! Deluxe is a massive (and free!) update to Choice Provisions' hit game Woah Dave! Its features include:* Two new levels, each of which will challenge even the best Woah Dave! players to rethink their strategy* New characters in the form of:- Adoma (of Destructamundo fame)!- Jr. Melchkin (of BIT.TRIP fame)!- CommandgirlVideo (of BIT.TRIP fame)!- Mr. Robotube (of Robotube Games fame)!- BlokTom (of Bloktonik fame)!- Plus a new, hidden character. Find them if you can!* Boss battles!* New enemy types!* Rideable UFOs!* A “Classic Mode” for all those Woah Dave! purists who would prefer their game remain unchanged!* Maybe a few additional Easter eggs…!A huge amount of work went into making Woah Dave! Deluxe a worthwhile update for players. Tears were shed. Minds were blown. And being totally honest, I think we learned a thing or two about ourselves along the way.**Check out what critics have to say about Woah Dave!**"Arcade Perfection." -Gamezebo"Woah Dave! is a must." -TouchArcade"There's hours of arcade fun, strange charm, and game design science here." - Destructoidhttp://woahdave.comhttp://totallychoice.comhttp://twitter.com/totallychoice																						关于这款游戏							From the folks behind the BIT.TRIP series comes the frantic insanity that is WOAH DAVE! Help our hero, Dave Lonuts, survive an insane alien invasion and line his pockets with shiny pennies.Hurl alien eggs, skull bombs, and explosive WOAH blocks to stay alive and sky rocket yourself to high score fame and fortune.The brave players who manage to survive the alien onslaught and collect the most coins will be rewarded with top placement on the fierce online leaderboards. Do you have what it takes to be the world’s best Dave? Or will you end up playing second fiddle to another, more powerful Dave? Woah Dave! also features a local two-player competitive mode, where two Daves can go head-to-head in a battle to collect the most coins. We aren’t exaggerating when we say it could very well result in ruined friendships and unsalvageable marriages. Competitive games are good like that.If that isn’t enough Dave for you, there’s also Bonkers Mode with more aliens, more lava, and more chances to get killed. Those who brave the storm will be rewarded with a splendor of precious coinage; those who fail will be revoked of their License to Dave.Good luck, and may the best Dave win.
