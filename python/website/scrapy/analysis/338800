Seven Kingdoms II is without question one of the finest strategy games on the market, largely because the world it creates has realistic dynamics and complexity never overwhelms, but adds a richness found far too rarely in strategy games.”9.1 rating - Gamespot – http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/seven-kingdoms-ii-review/1900-2532952/“Seven Kingdoms II is a highly-enjoyable and highly-detailed strategy game with seemingly limitless options and avenues for replayability. If you were one of the folks who missed out on its predecessor because you already dumped your cash on other RTS games or perhaps felt the genre was over-saturated, be sure to consider this sequel for an entertaining and deeply challenging gaming experience.”8.6 rating - IGN – http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/17/seven-kingdoms-ii-the-fryhtan-wars“Seven Kingdoms II is a deep, rich, incredibly satisfying game that blends myriad gameplay elements with a near-perfect balance ......
