desc_long							评测						“Black Closet offers the fantasy of being a police chief, with tension derived from choices that matter mechanically and narratively.”RockPaperShotgun“There are games that get into what it means to be in a position of power. Democracy 3 has you leading a country. Hanako's previous title, Long Live the Queen, tasks players with keeping a young monarch alive. But it's rare to see one handle the issue of corruption, and why someone might turn to it. After making clear the severity of the situation, Black Closet gives people the chance to see how easy it is to succumb to such temptations.”SyFyGames“I can only imagine the reaction of a school girl when two members of the student council show up at her room with a riding crop, a pair of high heels, some candy, and a small animal decoy.”TechZwn												关于这款游戏							A game of boardroom politics, lesbian romance, and schoolgirl noir. 9 AM Monday morning. A report lands on your desk: Jeanette's monogrammed silver locket has gone missing. The last time she definitely remembers having it, she was walking in the Field with her friend Susan. Shifty hallmate Ashley had also been admiring the locket recently.Do you:Drag Ashley in for interrogation?Comb the Field for clues?Try to stimulate Jeanette's memory?Put Susan under surveillance?Solve the case quickly, and everyone will applaud your leadership. Be too heavy-handed in your approach, and public opinion will turn against you. Let a thief slip through your fingers to strike again, and the whole school's reputation will suffer.
