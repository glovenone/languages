The act of sneaking around, of taking quick action when spotted and then getting into a kill position with a knife, or making that perfect throw ... it's a rush that I might never have experienced in a game before.”Polygon“Budget Cuts reminds me of classic Valve single-player games. That’s a very, very exciting thing.”Kotaku“I can’t wait to play more of Budget Cuts, which might be the best, most interesting VR game I’ve played.”IGN												关于这款游戏							Budget Cuts is a VR stealth game for the HTC Vive, currently in development by Neat Corporation.
