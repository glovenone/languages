Choose your own fight: gameplay blends fast-paced FPS action with precision sniping thrilling stealth, and deadly sabotage in the first open-ended WW2 game.         Deal death from afar: use sniper rifles to decimate enemy ranks and pick off officers, enemy snipers and heavy weapons gunners with deadly precision.         Breathtaking visuals, interactive environments and spectacular action across many iconic Resistance operations of WW2.

Engaging, destructible environments and advanced tactical AI means combat is always a rewarding and dynamic experience.         Highly replayable 10 hour Single-Player Campaign and 12-player Online Multiplayer, all powered by CRYENGINE technology.
