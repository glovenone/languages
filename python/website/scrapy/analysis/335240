There’s always a trick in these uncaring set-ups!Shaman mouse, Pro Gamer or loser? Good or evil? You're in charge! Every round, one of the player is the almighty Shaman who can use his skills to help his fellow mice get safely to the cheese... or ruin everything? The more mice you save, the faster you will level up in the Shaman's skill trees to build amazing contraptions! Create whatever your imagination can come up with, the fate of the game is at your fingertips.No Two Games Are AlikeWill a horde of mice rush in and get everybody killed? Will the Shaman successfully get you to the cheese? Or ruin it all? Will the cannon balls let you?

Participate in the upcoming events, create your own tribe and share on the forums. Challenge your friends to get the top titles and then challenge the world by farming your “firsts”! You'll be challenged by dozens if not hundreds of other mice to be the best.The Ethical Free to Play Business ModelTransformice is -literally- free to play. HATS! All the items you can buy are and will always be cosmetic: you will never see a gameplay item! Also, 100% of the buyable items are unlockable ingame: that's right, only with your skill you can have them all! Good luck though, some "master achievements" items are very difficult to get. Every cheese you bring back is added to your wallet: the more cheese you have, the more content you will unlock.
