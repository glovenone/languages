desc_long							评测						“The Preposterous Awesomeness of Everything may at times be too pleased with it’s eviscerating critique of Western civilization but this does not change the fact that this short, albeit inspired adventure game packs essential truths of life in it’s two hours. Ideal drinking companion for malcontents, loners and assorted Enemies of the Majority.”79/100 – Ragequit“The Preposterous Awesomeness of Everything is a strange little game that provides a satirical commentary on society today in both smartly subtle and knock-you-on-the-head obvious ways.”70/100 – Gaming Trend												关于这款游戏							The Preposterous Awesomeness of Everything is a satirical point-and-click adventure game, about progress, politics and propulsive nozzles. It features a traditional verb-based interface, with updated verbs (including 'befuddle', 'disrespect' and 'pray-for'), unique collage-based art and ~15,000 words (3-4 hours?) of intellectually stimulating satirical shenanigans. The preposterous Awesomeness of Everything is about an apparently primitive society, attempting to work together to build a space rocket. It follows these people, from disordered chaos (the past), through a disgusting and distorted and horrible and hilarious kind of faux-democracy (the present (SATIRE! Amirite?!?!)), into the unknowable, irrelevant emptiness of outer space (the future).Along the journey players will encounter a host of colourful characters (including the mysterious Man with the Little Pencil, the superfluous Man in the Wren Suit and the fabulous Helen), they will solve a variety of engaging puzzles, and they will be forced into making a number of difficult moral decisions, with potential disastrous consequences!Features:Traditional verb-based interfaceUpdated verbs (including 'befuddle', 'disrespect' and 'pray-for')Unique collage-based artA cameo appearance from Felix Kjellberg (PewDiePie) ~15,000 words (3-4 hours?) of intellectually stimulating satirical shenanigansA joke about white blood cellsProhibitively experimental electronic musicIrrelevant duck
