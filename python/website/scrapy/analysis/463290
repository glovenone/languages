desc_long								关于这款游戏							Would you like to know what the future holds in store for you? Put on your Oculus Rift or HTC Vive headset and take part in a first-of-its-kind VR experience: Kismet. Developed by award-winning creative studio Psyop, Kismet is a collection of three activities, including a past-present-future Tarot Card reading (“The Cards”), daily Astrology session (“The Stars”), and ancient boardgame Ur (“A Game of Wit”). Powered by a deck of 22 hand-painted Tarot cards and an accurate real-time map of the solar system, Kismet is meant to be experienced daily, with unique outcomes every calendar day that are directly tied to not only the cards that you choose, but your individual birth date and the actual alignment of celestial bodies at the time of your reading. Seated across a table from an enchanted automaton with the power to look into the future, you’ll be transported to a place where magic is real. Named after the mysterious character at its core, Kismet is inspired by the mystic arts of tarot and astrology, brought to life in a beautifully detailed, handmade, Gothic style.Seated Position & Controls:Attention HTC Vive Users: Because Kismet is a sitting experience in a room scale environment, we recommend that you find a comfortable place to sit down and then reset your seated position at that point. To do that on the Vive, push the bottom button on your motion controller to bring up the Steam menu, aim at the Settings cog at the bottom of the menu, pull the trigger, and select "Reset Seated Position" from the General VR Settings menu. After that, you can move your head around to inspect the details of the environment and take advantage of positional audio within the experience.Attention Oculus Rift Users: Kismet is available in two versions, one for Vive and one for Rift. To launch the Rift version, you need to find the game in your Library, right click it, and launch it in the "Other VR" mode (as opposed to Vive mode). If you accidentally launch Vive mode, such as through an icon created during the game's Steam installation process, the game will be unable to find your Xbox controller.Kismet is designed to work with each individual headset's bundled controllers. On Vive it is compatible with motion control, on Rift it is compatible with Microsoft Xbox One gamepad.Kismet has multiple graphics quality settings which are bound to the keyboard. The Lowest quality setting is mapped to the "1" key, Medium is set to "2", and the High graphics setting is mapped to "3". Kismet's default render quality is set to "2" Medium, and will run on minimum specification hardware. If your machine is more powerful than minimum specifications, try bumping up to the next rendering level!
