The game takes on the mix of Little Red Riding Hood – a European fairy tale- and The Lost Wolves of Japan -a book about Japanese history, literature and folklore.”8.9/10 – MMOHUT“Akaneiro provides players with a free to play ARPG of depth, blended seamlessly with the speed and intensity of a pure action title.”3/5 – Bloody Disgusting													Starter Pack									Akaneiro is available for FREE on other platforms (like SpicyWorld and Kongregate), but not on Steam.
