On the PC it's all so much better thanks to MicroProse's considerable talent in using the host machine's capabilities and surrounding it with top-notch presentation.”95 – The Games Machine (UK)“Compulsive, addictive and ruinous to your social life. Only a couple a packages can compare with this. The graphics are quite superb and the manual makes enthralling reading, even if you never go near the game.”91 – The One“The same engrossing gameplay as the ST, and a graphics mode to suit every PC. Not as hot a sim as LHX, but an excellent package nonetheless.”89 – Computer and Video Games												关于这款游戏							The Air Force won't even talk about it. Now it's yours to fly!
