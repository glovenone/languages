desc_long								关于这款游戏							Call of Juarez is an epic adventure western themed FPS game. The player alternately assumes the roles of two distinct, antagonistic characters: a sneaking fugitive Billy and his hunter the reverend Ray. Apart from the highly interesting, emotional and psychological aspect of the link between the two characters, the player will experience a variety of gameplay with many differences whilst playing a particular character.					The game features fast paced revolver duels using historically accurate firearms, horseback riding, mounted combat and stealth actions in memorable locations set after Western movies. Emergent gameplay based on accurate simulation of not only rigid bodies and rag-dolls but also liquids, gases, fire and smoke makes the gameplay innovative and non-linear.					Very serious approach to the Wild West theme and detailed reconstruction of the character and visuals of that times					The use of physics and innovative simulation of fire, liquids, dust, smokes and gases to construct emergent gameplay					State of the art graphics making use of the top technology graphics cards features on todays cards.					Playing 2 distinct characters with different abilities and different gameplay					Horseback riding and saddle shooting, gunfighter duels					Using the whip to fight, move objects and move the player's character					Legendary weapons form the Gold Fever era and full akimbo mode for the hands on approach.					Exhilarating storyline with full of twists and turns in this exciting Western Genre.
