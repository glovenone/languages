I would love to meet the people who created such an engagingly silly universe.”95 – Electric Playground“After a short opening movie, the second adventure of Freddi Fish starts. This time Freddi and her friend Luther go to school. But - and altogether very fortunately, it's not going to be the usual teaching routine.”92 – Coming Soon Magazine“Not only is this one an entertaining game, but also it demands to be replayed over and over as some of the quest items are randomly placed and some of the essential pieces of the trap device will change from game to game thus presenting different problems to solve.”90 – Quandary													Humongous Tees Now Available!									Official Humongous Entertainment T-shirts featuring Pajama Sam, Spy Fox, Freddi Fish, and Putt-Putt are now available on Amazon. 																						关于这款游戏							So who is haunting the schoolhouse, taking the toys and practically scaring the scales off all the guppies?Good thing super-sleuths Freddi Fish and Luther are on the case.
