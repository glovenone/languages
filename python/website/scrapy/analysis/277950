Choose from three distinct types of breed, depending on your personal taste in look and style of play, may it be Nightbreed, Halfbreed or Daybreed. There are just too many unique aspects that differentiate the breeds to list here, but keep in mind that the sight range of Night- and Daybreed varies with the day cycles and that some items can be limited to a specific breed.Customization, Armory and ArtifactsDeadbreed® features a player centric customization feature, meaning the player has greater influence over his Hero’s look and capabilities. The items you equip not only shape the way the hero looks while playing, they dictate the way he/she moves and attacks to.Equipping a sword and a shield will make your hero a melee fighter with the sword’s range, while re-equipping the same hero as an archer changes your range and attack to bow and arrow. This opens up totally new ways to explore custom items builds best suited for that particular hero’s abilities, opponents and game scenarios.In addition to the possibility to adapt and remodel your favorite hero’s equipment choosing from a vast base armory, Deadbreed® features Artifacts. Artifacts are built during games like “normal” items, however they are unique meaning there can only be one in play at any given time during a game, adding an additional layer of strategy and tactical planning to hero item builds. In addition to this, Artifacts level up with games, unlocking relic slots that open up further customization opportunities for you to tune specific items for your favorite heroes. For fans of RPGs, the concept of “socketing” items should feel very familiar and for MOBA fans, you could really simplify this by saying we have moved the “runes” stats modifications associated with the player to individual items instead, and added unique effects on top to make these items really stand out in gameplay.The SentinelsThe Sentinels are ancient guardians of the Deadbreed® bloodlines – arbitrators of the infernal battlegrounds where dead breed strive to break their undead bonds and lay to final rest. These immortal deities have been charged solely with construction of and ruling over the battlegrounds of death and decay as a punishment for their doings in the real world, but behind the façades, they vie for power while swaying the dead breeds to their philosophy – an eternal conflict among themselves for the right to lead an uprise from this hell and reclaim their rightful place in the cosmos.As you progress in the game, you’ll uncover the cabal of the Sentinels and learn more about their individual weaknesses and strengths and how they fit your heroes and play style. You prove your Zeal for a Sentinel by choosing it as your Guardian in a match. Then the outcome of that game will modify your Standing with that particular Sentinel, affecting its strengths, abilities and enhancements in coming games making it a more formidable last boss for the enemy team to conquer in order to win (and the other way around). As your Zeal increases, you’ll open up further paths of the cabal and gain access to older and more powerful Sentinels to devote to. Will you stay loyal to a specific breed lineage or even a single Sentinel? There are strategic decisions to be made and rewards to be claimed on a daily basis as your loyalty to the Sentinels are put to the test.Maps, Dungeons and PvE FeaturesThe practice game kicks off with The Graveyard. At its core, the Graveyard is a 3vs3 two-lane map with a Citadel at each end protected by monoliths. The overall goal of the map is to break the crux on the gates to gain access to the Citadel and defeat the enemy team’s Sentinel.The Graveyard also features a Troll Cave where you can summon a Troll to fight for your side, two smaller dungeons on each team’ s side of the map and an entrance to a larger Dungeon placed dead center of the map. The concept of Dungeons is familiar to all hack’n slash fans – and our game has plenty of monsters and loot, however the big difference being that our Dungeons are much, much smaller in size and offer no way out than the way you went in, leaving you vulnerable to the enemy team. So, dungeons are our “mini-adventure” version of other MOBA’s monster nests.Once you are more familiar with the core gameplay you should give the other two maps a try.The Mirage Map features a Stone where you are able to socket Mirage Resources found in the map to transform into a Massive Golem while The Zodiac Map features the Bell of Bones where you are able to socket Zodiac Resources found in the map to ring the Bell and summon an undead horde to fight for your team.LeaderboardsEvery game you play in PvP will give you a score and a placement at the monthly Leaderboard. Winning and losing matches change this score and ending up in the top three at the end of the month will earn you special rewards.Ranked ModeRanked mode allows you to test your skills against opponents of comparable skill and earn special ranks to reflect your skill. Winning and losing matches can gain or lose rank, and special rewards, like custom Insignia, gravestones etc. Each player's rank is reflected in their Gravestone and plaque. There are currently 5 divisions ranging from Bronze up to Diamond, with each division split in 5 series.
