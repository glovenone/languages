That’s why I’m so excited to see that Viscera Cleanup Detail, the space station janitor simulation, is now available on Steam Early Access.”PCGamer“By setting its mundane stall in the days after events that would be taken oh-so-seriously in another game, Viscera Cleanup Detail manages to be morbidly hilarious without ever telling a single joke.”EuroGamer												关于这款游戏							Disaster! An alien invasion and subsequent infestation have decimated this facility. Many lives were lost, the facility was ruined and the aliens were unstoppable. All hope was lost until one survivor found the courage to fight back and put the aliens in their place! It was a long and horrific battle as the survivor dueled with all manner of terrifying life-forms and alien mutations, but our hero won out in the end and destroyed the alien menace! Humanity was saved! Unfortunately, the alien infestation and the heroic efforts of the courageous survivors have left rather a mess throughout the facility.
