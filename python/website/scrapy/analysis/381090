Basically, you’ve got to fight the undead, while dodging giant razor baldes and/or fire and work your way towards bosses. It sounds unplayable, I know, but you’ll be relieved to hear that you are given a chainsaw, and a motorcycle at points. I can imagine those bits aren’t so hard. The most annoying parts aren’t the deaths form zombies or giant bosses though, it’s the unexpected deaths from sneakily placed barbed logs. When you take your first log death, that’s when you’ll know how hard this game is.”WOW 24/7												关于这款游戏							Ted by Dawn is a humor laden throwback to classic action platformers such as Mega Man and Metroid. The game focuses heavily on frantic platforming action complete with boss fights, spikes, and plenty of fire. Ted by Dawn follows the story of Ted Carcass, a reclusive survivor of the apocalypse. Ted is a rugged man, a man's man, a beard supporter, whiskey drinker, shotgun aficionado, and reluctant savior of the human race. There are no checkpoints, and death instantly restarts the stage. Muscle memory, memorization, and an iron will to survive are required for success.On a routine supply run to the local tavern, Hunter's Haven, Ted runs across a scientist. After an unfortunate skirmish with some fellow redneckians, Ted is left to escort his newly acquainted friend across the wasteland to find a suitable laboratory to synthesize a cure for the horrible mutagen that has ravaged the land. Along the way, Ted will meet with hordes of zombies, mutants, savage survivors, and apparently, flaming pants.
