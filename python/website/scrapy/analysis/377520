desc_long							评测						“Thanks to unusually capable TacAI, an excellent random map generator, and inspired combat mechanics I can honestly say I’ve enjoyed every battle I’ve orchestrated during the past six days.”Rock Paper Shotgun													New game from the creator of Pike and Shot									Sengoku Jidai: Shadow of the Shogun is developed in collaboration between Richard Bodley Scott, the mastermind behind Field of Glory and Pike & Shot, and Jayson Ng an active member of the community. The game expands P&S’s epic turn-based battles with some tactical enhancements and a new and colourful unit mix, embellished with a perfectly chosen art style.Battlefield generals are a major game changer and serve a hero role which players have to learn how to master. Units under the influence of their leaders will receive benefits, being less likely to break, and likely to inflict higher damage. The loss of an inspirational general can cause an entire frontline to crumble.The game is available now :)http://store.steampowered.com/app/397190																						关于这款游戏							In Pike and Shot you can march in the footsteps of the great leaders of one of the most amazing periods in European History as you take command in the mighty struggles of the Great Turkish War, the Thirty Years War and the English Civil War.
