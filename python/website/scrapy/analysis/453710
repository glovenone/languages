But! Here some things you should know about this game before you buy:TableTop Soccer requires an internet connection – Even when playing Solo games against the AI, you need to be online. This might be changed in a later update, but right now that's a requirement;TableTop Soccer is visually very simple; it's not a AAA title! It favors gameplay over graphics – this game will never tax your video card's capabilities;There is no offside rule!! That might sound crazy to you, especially if you haven't played the game yet, but I think it makes sense – for this game, at this time... If the community that plays the game starts to feel differently, I can add that back in!
