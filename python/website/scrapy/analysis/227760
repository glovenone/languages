Engaging engagements, feisty AI, low price.”80/100 – PC Gamer“If a real-time version of Risk on steroids mixed with Diplomacy's double-dealing sounds appealing, then March of the Eagles is well worth picking up.”7/10 – Gamespot“March of the Eagles may have more limited ambitions than its grand strategy cousins, but in limiting its goals it makes its successes more evident. It's a relatively brief and accessible strategy experience that's good alone and better with friends.”7,9/10 – IGN												关于这款游戏							“he Who Fears Being Conquered Is Sure Of Defeat.”The war-game March of the Eagles focuses on the dramatic conflicts of Europe during 1805 to 1820.
