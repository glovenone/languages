It involved a kingdom threatened by a wizard so powerful, their only defense was to encase him in a mystic bubble. A small orb, the Dragonsphere, shows the rulers of this land how the shield is holding...and now, the orb has begun to crack!”100 – Techtite“An exciting new graphic adventure, packed with people and places to discover. It could be longer, allowing for more detailed interaction with the characters you meet. It's easy to lose yourself in this fresh, engaging game.”87 – PC Gamer“Dragonsphere is weighed down by some derivative fantasy elements and subpar production design. Yet, it remarkably rises above its shortcomings with a solid, well written plot and creative puzzles. In all, the game lives up to the promise of its developer of delivering an engaging fantasy adventure, even if it is not the most intricate or involved ever written.”80 – Adventure Classic Gaming												关于这款游戏							Travel to the land of the fantastic!Newly-crowned King of Callahach!
