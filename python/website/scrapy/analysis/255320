How are you supposed to review a game that’s actually a piece of art?”93% – Gamona“Let's have a round of applause for the probably most insane adventure of all time! […] Edna is the prime example for how elements of a game perfectly come together when a creative developer can push through his ideas without any compromises.”88% – 4Players“Point & Click in perfection. But Edna isn’t outdated in any way, thanks on the one hand to the beautiful 2D comic style and on the other hand the out-there humor.”ComputerBild Spiele													Buy Harvey's New Eyes:									http://store.steampowered.com/app/219910/																						关于这款游戏							The award-winning debut adventure game from the creators of Deponia and The Whispered World now on Steam.

Together, they attempt an escape and, in doing so, meet their extremely bizarre fellow patients – from the man in the bee costume to the pseudo-Siamese twins Hoti and Moti.
