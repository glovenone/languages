What counts is that this a fun game - I found many of Rex's remarks and object and location descriptions very witty, even though not everyone might like Rex's kind of humor. But I did and that's why Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender-Bender gets an A- from me.”91 – Just Adventure												关于这款游戏							A priceless vase is lost on a distant planet that doesn't exist!
