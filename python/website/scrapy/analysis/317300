Okay, maybe we're overselling it.Either way, you're invited along with either Max or Anne as they make their way through the first year of their college experience. They'll share their dorm life with four other tenants as they pick their class load, pick their jobs, and maybe even pick someone to have a little extra curricular fun with.Neither of them can get through college without you, so who will you help? Rock god Max or Book-smart Anne? Between bitter tenured professors and a ridiculously distracting student body, it's going to take everything they've got just to make it to year two.GAME FEATURESPlay as Anne and romance Dominic, Rakesh, Max and IsabellaPlay as Max and romance Sally, Anne, Isabella and RakeshHilarious light comedy writing guaranteed to make you laughLife simulation gameplay with full scheduler and stats raisingOST by Leetstreet Boys including the main theme "Name In Lights"
