In Lucadian Chronicles each card has a variety of stats and abilities, as well as a color and cost. The heart of the game is creating teams that conform to color and cost limits while taking advantage of card synergies to conquer the opponent's team.Single PlayerThe single-player portion of the game has a full story with branching paths. It's designed to test the strategy limits of the player with challenging optional branches and objectives.Multiplayer LeaguesIn Leagues you join a pool of other players and fight them asynchronously. League play stresses the overall strength of your collection, the ability to identify trends in the meta strategy, and to adapt to what the players in your specific leagues are doing.Multiplayer DraftsDraft mode is a real-time pure test of skill in which all players begin on even footing, regardless of existing collection. In drafts you first pick the cards you'll use , then enter a mini-tournament in which you have access to only those cards.Cross-platform PlayThe Steam version of Lucadian Chronicles allows for matchmaking in both leagues and drafts with the existing Wii U player base.FeaturesA full single-player story modeAsynchronous multi-player league playReal-time draft tournamentsOver 100 cards beautifully illustrated cards to use and collectNo microtransactions of any kindNote: Lucadian Chronicles Requires an Internet Connection in All ModesLucadian Chronicles requires a persistent internet connection to play, including in the single-player modes.All the major logic and account data is server-based. This is to prevent cheating while maintaining consistency between the single and multi-player modes, to allow us to fix rules problems, edit text and tutorials, add challenges, etc, without requiring client patches or running into versioning problems.If this is a problem for you for whatever reason we understand. We want to be up front about the game requirements while ensuring players that these requirements exist for legitimate reasons not related to DRM or data collection. (The game contains no DRM or data collection of any kind beyond basic gameplay stats)
