By making old obstacles suddenly seem impossible, it shows the player what it feels like to surrender oneself to encroaching inevitability, to just give up and embrace what’s coming.”Pure Sophistry“Potatoman Seeks the Troof is an experience well worth having. It’s teeming with clever writing and charm, not to mention an appearance and soundtrack that do a fantastic job of scratching that nostalgia itch.”Gamezebo“Potatoman has the best jump in the history of video games, seriously.”PewDiePie												关于这款游戏							Potatoman Seeks the Troof is a challenging potatosophical platforming adventure from Pixeljam Games, creator of the classic prehistoric racer DINO RUN.Potatoman will put your reflexes and worldview to the test as you journey through scorching deserts, dark forests, busy cities, the tallest mountains and eventually your own potato-consciousness in search of the ultimate answer.
