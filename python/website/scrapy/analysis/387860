desc_long							评测						“...was a total gut punch. I didn't have any words when the experience was over... It's been in my head for days”Kotaku“In less than 20 minutes The Static Speaks My Name manages to be dark, sad, funny and disturbing”Rock, Paper, Shotgun“A short and unforgettable experience... Full of surprises, great attention to detail and dark humor.”Alpha, Beta, Gamer												关于这款游戏							A dark/sad/weird/funny first person exploration game. You play a man on his last night alive as he obsesses over a mysterious painting. More of a story game in that it emphasizes mood and character over gameplay. Takes ten minutes to play and has "next-gen" features like a shrimp tank with pet shrimp. Be warned, the game contains explicit handling of suicide.For people that have played the game elsewhere, this is the original version, not an expansion or HD remake.
