My only qualms about it are the things it’s lacking due to being unfinished (polish and multiplayer); other than that it’s a solid tactical combat game and I would recommend it to fans of that genre.”70/100 – OverPowered Noobs“Ground Breakers, besides featuring 5 v. 5 battles and procedural combat maps, you see, innovates by featuring dynamic, constantly changing battlefields, a crafting system and highly customizable unique units.”N/A – IndieGames dot com“Ground Breakers is a pretty surprising game so far. On the surface it looks like a rather simplistic tactical RPG but once you start playing it you realize that there’s more depth to the game than you previously thought. There’s a bunch of different robots to unlock, excellent and unique battle maps and it all looks great to boot. Definitely one to keep an eye on, it’s already quite the interesting game.”N/A – Universal Gaming Reviews												关于这款游戏							Dominate the world with your robot army, research new robots and customize their abilities!
