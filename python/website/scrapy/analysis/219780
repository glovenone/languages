It's been a long time since I've played an RPG that manages to balance a lengthy, in-depth story with such a self-aware and hilarious script”– IncGamers“The writing is consistently terrific, from the genuinely creative quests with multiple solutions to the NPCs which are all hand-crafted and infused with personality. Where other games would have copy + pasted Unclickable Villager A and B a few dozen times, Divinity 2 gives you an actual village, complete with gossipers, philanderers, military deserters, the occasional secret murderer, and even a few normal people”9/10 – SomethingAwful“It's amazing such a good game remained undiscovered until this "remastered" version was released. (...) The quests are surprisingly good, with charming voicework and a great sense of humour - and then there's the exploration, with hidden caverns and keys rewarding diligent players” – RPGWatch												关于这款游戏							Dragons: they have been hunted, they have been slain, but now the hour to strike back has come.
