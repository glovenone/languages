desc_long							评测						“...it tells a story without saying a word, truly a special thing in this modern age of boom, talk, boom games.”9/10 – PlayStation LifeStyle“If you choose to see Pillar as a good looking 2.5D puzzle game with plenty of puzzles to solve, that's fine. Simplified, it is that. However, Pillar is about more and if you choose to dive a bit deeper into the meaning of what you're actually doing, it will make a lot of sense.”4/5 – Softpedia“...a fantastic game, one which is simple yet challenging enough to tease anyone thinking it will be an easy playthrough, while rewarding the ones who embrace the spirit of the game.”4/5 – Invision Game Community													数字豪华版									Deluxe edition includes the game's soundtrack, an album of bonus tracks, concept art, photography that inspired the game and more!																						关于这款游戏							Pillar is a collection of minigames, where each game represents a different type of personality we find in people. Each personality is expressed entirely through the gameplay mechanics, without cutscenes or dialogue. All too often, we try to change people who are different than us, especially if they're polar opposites. We like to debate and tell them they're wrong and we're right... but what if there's a purpose for both extremes?A Little Bit More About Pillar:A collection of minigames, each representing different personality traits (introversion, extroversion etc.) through gameplay mechanics.Different people, different gameplay; each part of the game will challenge you in a unique way.Explore an intimate snowy town, beautifully hand-painted with attention to every detail.A distinct soundtrack, composed hand in hand with the game's design, by the game's designer, to ensure a cohesive experience.
