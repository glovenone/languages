[...] There's a lot to be said for a game that can make a grown woman squeal with glee dozens of times in a playthrough (especially a game that doesn't star Hello Kitty). In short, the long wait for Fez is entirely worth it. Play it, and I dare you not to smile."100% – Joystiq"The game's unique artwork, its perspective-shift mechanic, its nostalgia for the 16-bit years and its bewitchingly strange setting all exist in total harmony and make a single, deliberate statement." 10/10 – Eurogamer"The sum of Fez’s intelligent level designs, perception mechanic, massive number of stages and secrets, and incredible art is so much more than just a shout-out to old-school gaming. Fez is a game in love with games."9.5/10 – http://ca.ign.com/articles/2012/04/11/fez-review												关于这款游戏							Gomez is a 2D creature living in a 2D world. Or is he?
