desc_long							评测						“Seraph looks, feels and plays like that inevitable point in gaming history whereby a genre finally takes that next, pivotal step both mechanically and artistically to create something inspiringly elegant and evermore memorable as a result.”Hardcore Gamer												关于这款游戏							The GameSeraph is a skill based, acrobatic combat platformer. Featuring an angel, known as Seraph, who's fighting to restore her lost power and ultimately escape a prison infested with demons. However, dark magic has trapped the angel inside her human Vessel: if the Vessel dies, so will Seraph.Key FeaturesGun-fu acrobatic combat - Seraph chooses her own targets with a wide range of deadly firearms, allowing the player to focus on acrobatic evasion instead. Dodge enemy attacks with lightning fast reactions and look awesome while doing it!Dynamic difficulty scaling - The on-screen difficulty rating ensures that the game is always challenging. The better you do, the harder the enemies (but the greater the rewards!). Designed to be replayed - Levels are procedurally generated and filled with random pick-ups, enemies and bosses. Craft new weapons, Miracles and protective items through the Transmutation feature and unlock powerful passive Oaths for your next demonic encounter. Daily and weeky challenge leaderboards allow you to test your mettle against other players.Not a rogue-like! - Seraph can be slain in her battles, but doing so will mean resurrecting with less maximum health. Discover hidden checkpoint orbs to save your start point through the campaign if you die completely.Twitch features - Seraph can be played in Twitch mode, allowing viewers to vote between levels to give the Streamer a positive or negative modifier, which then actually alters the game! Seraph is designed to be played at 60 frames per second; if you are experiencing sluggish performance, please ensure that 'Nvidia Optimus' has not disabled your graphics card when playing the game.Streamers, YouTubers and PressSeraph features Twitch integration and special webcam feed support!
