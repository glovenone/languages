All that was left were a few islands, connected by magic portals.Now, only a few years after the end of the Convocation, evil is back - stronger and more powerful than ever before - to finish what was started. Yet there is still hope. The prophecies tell of a human. A human damned to immortality, bound forever by the power of the blood runes…Soon, the time will come when the power of one may change the destiny of many. For better or for worse...SpellForce: Shadow of the PhoenixBy means of an enslaved god's life essence a dark necromancer is trying to reanimate the powerful circle mages and make them his unholy servants.
