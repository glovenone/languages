desc_long								关于这款游戏							Experience dragons in their proper role as the monstrous, complex, and epic protagonists that they are. In this open world action role-playing game you will bring your dragon's story to life. As you eat, age and hunt your dragon will develop allowing you to improve and customize its wings, tail, claws, and breath weapon. Become a terrifying or benevolent dragon powerful enough to threaten city states and reshape kingdoms.  Inevitably you will face other dragons, giants, trolls, orcs, liches, and other beasts as you leave your mark on the history of the world.Curious?
