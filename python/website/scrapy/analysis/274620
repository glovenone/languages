I know not how to describe it with intelligible language—surely the Authorities must have words to describe these cosmic occurrences…" -Saltés Borian, Governor of ValemteimCelem is no longer the only Light that governs the world of Skara. Lôm, the lesser Light, engaged Celem in a celestial combat, wreaking havoc upon all that depended upon Him for life. Now the Lands of the Long North freeze while the Long South burns. Empires have fallen. Many have perished. And many more will continue to, err what is left of Skara is reclaimed by those with the will to dominate. Will you?    Fear comes from the belly. So Khärn cut the belly to let it out.Born from the bowels of Skara, these mysterious and violent raiders of the land are by far the strongest of all. However, their brute strength makes them slow, offering brave opponents a brief opportunity for victory. ...Soon all will know, and fear, the Sons of Fire.The tireless Celea escaped their burning homes to settle in a new land. Little did they know how soft and unprepared that land would be. Unstoppable in groups, the Celea are masters of Atash. “Anger that sits burns its bearer, Anger that moves burns others” -Shinse proverbThe Shinse lost their ancestral lands on Skara’s coast to the invading Celea. Now they seek revenge. Swift and agile, the Shinse have only two types of opponents: The quick and the dead. “Gaal spake, the sound summoning Tamvaasa to spring from the seaGaal was so glad in His glory, He gave great gifts to TamvaasaFood for feeding, fields to frolick in, and forests for wondering…” -Tamvaasa creation hymnThe Tamvaasa descend from the Long North, a hardened race with a proud history and an age old rivalry with their southern neighbours, the Durno. Their piercing attacks, combined with powerful song-lore taken from the wild, makes them a force to reckon with.Ask not how old the dust is below your feetOne day you will be it—a Shinse sayingThere are many ways to perish in Skara; Not just at the hands of an enemy. Fall from a great height, melt in subterranean fire, drown, get crushed, or meet Him… … Don’t say we didn’t warn you.Part of the vision of Skara is to allow players to literally become the protagonists of an unfolding drama.
