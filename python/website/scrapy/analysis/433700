Even more fascinating: the levels were designed inside the virtual reality world using a touch controller.”c't magazin“The benefits of room-scale virtual reality are obvious in puzzle games like this.”Polygon“The first time I grabbed an ‘L’ pipe piece and pulled it from background to foreground in 3D and saw it rotate as it changed planes, I knew this was going to tap into a part of my brain I wasn’t used to using in puzzle games.”PC Gamer												关于这款游戏							Solve tricky puzzles in a world full of mysterious secrets.
