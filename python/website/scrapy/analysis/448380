The top-down view of a car madly swerving around to escape the cops certainly helped, but after playing a bit – actually a big bit – of Escape: Close Call I found it to be a very engaging, enjoyable and fun game. It’s actually one of the most addictive I’ve played recently. I certainly had a hard time putting it down, always going for one more go.”Positive – Final Boss Fight“It's like I'm playing Michael Bay - The Game.”Positive – YouTuber Mr Falcon“If you guys like simple games with an addictive quality that are just fun as hell for not much money, then get this game now.”96/100 – YouTuber Zaxtor99												关于这款游戏							How long can you last?Escape: Close Call is an adrenaline pumping driving game which rewards near crashes with style points, encouraging risk and thrill seeking.
