desc_long							评测						“Check the first preview of the game on KeenGamer site!”Preview – KeenGamer												关于这款游戏							Warning!Game is in early access, before purchasing the game, make sure that you fully understand and agree with its system’s requirements and are willing to accept flaws/bugs and changes that will occur during its development such as removing all user data. Information below may not be currently fulfilled in this version of the game. Thank you for understanding.PROLOGNovus Inceptio is a survival sandbox game with elements of MMO. It isnt primarily focused on the destruction of structures, the main objective of the game is to create and maintain shared values. Since the game is currently in early access or in GHOST mode, our goal is to create a proper MMO survival adventure focused on building new civilizations.In the GHOST mode, only single player and 64km2 of workable land is available. GHOST mode is a sample of the full MMO and serves as a preview of the interactions, gaming principes, and the mechanics. Novus Inceptio is a mix of sci-fi, fantasy and the post apocalyptical world in an unique way. The story is set in distant future on our planet. Earth is no longer how we know it today. Therefore one of the most important topics of the background story is to find out the truth about those who stand behind it all since the beginning...BACKGROUND STORYThe dawn of godsGalaxy is a cold and hostile place. Creators know that. They spent billions of years searching for intelligent life and they succeeded. They protect several planets and further developed organisms with advanced technology. Life must not come to an end. Meanwhile, they realize all the risks which await on every civilization such as a destructive genocide. They try to prevent these risks by secretly manipulating and adding information to DNA from foreign forces.Rebellious believersCreators stand side by side with the human civilization since its initiation. But no one is perfect. Not even gods. Instead of maintaining peace, humans tend to worship war and forget about their gods. And Creators? They realized that their experiment failed. They could not stop fratricidal madness among humans. When the last envoy was killed, nailed to the cross, they returned back where they came from through a portal. To a different planet? To another reality? No one knows. But what we do know is that they keep collecting information through the portal.The end of the worldThe next step of the human civilization took nearly 2000 years. During this era a nuclear fission was discovered and whole planet became full of atomic explosions. The war was horrifying and efficient. Everyone who did not hide was hit by radiation and killed. From billions of humans, barely a few hundred thousand were left. This scary message was brought to the creators. They were outraged by the human irresponsibility. They came back and erased the whole human race.  Human 2.0The Dead planet kept orbiting in space. During millennia it was slowly getting rid of deadly radiation. The makers decided to begin with a new experiment. With samples of human DNA and surplus of  information they returned life to the planet. They made new humans - Homo Novus. They released them on a newly reconstructed planet and were determined to prevent the same mistakes. Therefore, every clone is now accompanied by a personal robot A2-A.DISCOVER WORLDS!A2-A is the guardian angel. It helps and protects people and over time gives them more a complex knowledge. It monitors behavior of its ward to prevent increase in aggression, which caused the demise of the previous civilization. Still, this system is not completely reliable. Creators counted on that. They created anomalies on the new planet, so clones can travel in time and learn from mistakes of past civilizations. And who knows? Anomalies might even transfer them into another dimension. Maybe then, people will devote their time to discovery and knowledge, rather than killing and destroying.And the Creators? This time they don‘t leave the planet, instead they analyze data from thousands of A2-As and wait for the right moment to introduce themselves to their children.MAIN GAMEPLAY FEATURES OF GHOST VERSIONWORLD IS NOT DEAD SCENEWe wanted to build an authentic world that is not just a one big scene. Almost everything can be interacted with - from surface, bushes, trees to your own structures. There are no flowers that are mere decoration - do you want grab that mushroom and eat it? Go for it! Even a simple tree does not only provide wood, but also other resources like bark, leaves, branches, resins etc.Novus inceptio is world with a natural time flow, daily cycles and weather. Day and night affects wild animals as well and if you stop and listen, you can hear the nature or enjoy the beautiful atmospheric music and relax.UNLIMITED POSSIBILITESNovus Inceptio allows a natural creation of the character. Characters will get old and die  from injures, diseases or exhaustion. In this case, players will find themselves in the role of A2-A and using DNA will create a new clone with same attributes. Another possibility in future updates is transferring DNA to offspring, that allows the player to continue if their main character dies. Aging is not affecting  just the player, but also every object in the game. Players will not be able to harvest basic resources or even exchange them for future needs.And why is Novus Inceptio worth playing? Unlike other games, there are no limits on player‘s skills. Players have complete freedom while making their ultimate character. You wont need to think about starting race or role - attributes will be added according to what is your character doing.LORE AFFECTING THE GAMEUnlike other survival sandbox games Novus Inceptio has its background an lore, which is not only something irelevant. Full story and lore will be revealed over time. This feature opens up new possibilities in upcoming updates.ANOMALIESThere are many portals to other dimensions and times (new will be added in future updates). Those anomalies cannot be mapped - they are randomly generated for each player. In those anomalies you can find unique reward and mostly learn new recipes. Currently anomalies possess no danger to player, but it is subject to be changed in the future.In new version of Novus Inceptio, you can find those specific anomalies, which are only small hint of what is to come:Procedural dungeons - each dungeons is unique and contains random rewardsMore dimensions and time periods - desert or winter locationsTime flashback - player travels through the time, but stays in the same place. Those anomalies are mainly to learn recipes.SURVIVE!In the beginning  the game puts you in the middle of wild and untended nature. With you will only a knife and basic tools. Fortunately, you are not alone! You small personal robot A2-A will be your valuable companion. Nature does not give things for free so you need to find sources of food, heat and prepare for danger, lurking in the deep woods. Also diseases, injuries or even death might knock on your door. Over time you will learn the laws of the world and only then you will be ready for your next trip.BUILD!Home is the foundation of survival. You can build your own house, farm and focus on one of the many crafts. The building system works using modular elements where you can plan first and then gather required resources (which, of course, will be a difficult task). The only limiting factors are knowledge of recipes for components, creativity, resources and skill. And of course don’t forget to repair damaged or decaying houses.You can learn to build new components by exploring anomalies or by buying them in the auction from other players (auctions will be featured in future updates). CREATE!Do you like crafting stuff? Then you will love Novus Inceptio. Each and every item in the game is unique and created by the player. Production of any item is a complex process built on many attributes from skill in the art to used material just like in the real world. Crafting system does not tell you how to craft, instead it states what resource is needed - using stone will create stone axe and using iron will produce iron axe - you can even use different materials on every part. For example the durability of the wood is also to be considered.Novus Inceptio rewards players for crafting. Item quality and technology will improve over time as well as character attributes.EXPLORE!It is not just about the settlement the world, but also about survival and creating a thriving economy. World of life, danger and mystery awaits. There are dense forests, dry desert, vast jungles, underwater life and mountains where you can find different raw materials in an area of 576km² or 222 square miles (64km² or 24 square miles in the GHOST version). Novus Inceptio is a long journey of finding valuable materials and truth about the origin of this new planet.Investigate the anomalies and find new recipes for crating - anomalies are a way to discover the unknown and expand the gameplay.
