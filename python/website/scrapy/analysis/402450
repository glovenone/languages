This is a living world, and a sandbox to boot.”MMOGames“The game’s PvP is a skill contest, and not the straight up level or gear contest you see in a lot of games.”8/10 – OPnoobs												关于这款游戏							Welcome to Linkrealms!Linkrealms is a Sandbox MMORPG that harks back to the roots of classic online role-playing games, where community was the center of the user experience, one's choices mattered, and reputation was earned on the battlefield rather than leaderboards. With its mix of old-school design choices, modern features and unique servers, Linkrealms caters to the needs of the hardcore mmo nostalgic as well as to the player looking for a more laidback online experience.Key Features:Player-driven EconomyGather resources through farming your own fields, mining and hunting, then sell them to others or convert them into valuable items using tools and your own skills. Take a player dedicated to cultivating his estates and brewing magical concoctions, and another one who enjoys locating mineral veins, extracting ores and crafting fine armors. When the two meet or use each other's vendors, there are profits for all!Classless GameplayRegardless of your character's race, you will gain all skills as you use them, and enhance your abilities further by gathering the best tools and equipment. As you become more powerful, you will begin to specialize and develop your own unique mix of talents. Join a guild as swordsman and illusion specialist, or run solo and get rich as farmer or miner with some fire magic on the side. You'll be able to experiment and change your focus over time, so go for it!Land OwnershipThe world of Linkrealms is divided into hundreds of realms. Claim yours and use it to build literally anything! Wall off your own fields, raise a guild hall for your friends and training zones for your pets, or just an awesome manor to inspire envy! You'll also be able to place vendors, set up switches and doors, traps, teleporters – and even monster spawners if you want to get a little more creative.Open Dungeons & Smart CreaturesThe world of Linkrealms is full of events and dungeons that are open for anyone to enter. If you're a solo thief, think twice before sneaking up on a large raiding party while they fight the boss monster! The most impressive creatures use advanced AI, giving them the sense to avoid danger and work in teams. Your pets share the same technology, can be bred for specific traits and trained in a punish/reward fashion.Catering to AllSome people like the old-school hardcore PVP rules, while others would rather not be surprised by assassins while using the out-house. Servers can vary not only in rule and skill sets, but may contain very different landscapes and dungeons. Fighting is a skill easily learned, but difficult to master - especially when other players are involved. There are many battle skills available, and what works against some may fail against others.Non-Invasive ShopPay once (or get a Beta Key) and play for free - forever. All of the content is available to you with no restrictions. Using the in-game store helps supporting the development team, but nothing a player can purchase is going to make him suddenly powerful or give him an unfair advantage. Linkrealms welcomes all players to the community!
