desc_long							评测						“As an example of classic, back to basics point and click adventuring, there can perhaps be no finer recent example in the genre than The Angel of Death - it's a nailed-down must-buy if you're an adventure diehard... It's got excellent production values, a great script, solid cast, a delightful orchestral score and some of the most challenging puzzles seen in a videogame for ages.”Eurogamer												关于这款游戏							After reluctantly battling dragons, Mayan gods, and becoming a knight of a long lost Holy Order, unwitting hero George Stobbart determines to settle down to a life of mundane 9-5 office work. Who would have thought that a mysterious and beautiful woman would enter his life; a woman whose sudden disappearance draws him into a desperate search for a nefarious artefact of great and terrible power? As forces of ancient worlds and past forgotten myths clash, current emotions will conflict with past regrets. Emotion, humor, and puzzling combine to draw the player into a dark world of conspiracy theories, daring adventures, and ancient societies. For George, it looks like the world needs saving. Again.
