desc_long								关于这款游戏							Grav|Lab would like to introduce our new range of gravity modifying appliances!No matter how fast or how heavy your objects are, we can move them! Save money and time by replacing your entire human workforce with automated appliances from Grav|LabCurrently awaiting regulatory approval, we invite you to visit our testing facility and give them a go! We have prepared a selection of test scenarios for you and we are certain you can solve them! Also, feel free to create your own test scenario and share them with fellow participants! Please be aware that strong gravitational forces can cause severe brain damage! Never look directly at the emitted particles! While we tried our best to avoid the creation of micro wormholes, please never try to stack gravitational objects. All damages to the time and space continuum and involved repair cost will be passed on to you!Our testing facility has limited amount of gravitation resistant controllers, so please bring your own headset when you visit our premises, preferably the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift+Touch.-- Grav|Lab Management
