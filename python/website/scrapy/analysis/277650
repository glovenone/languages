I'm just saying it's probably the best one that's going to hit the shelves this year.”90% – Worthplaying“Overall, Heretic Kingdoms is fun, fun, fun and destined to be a sleeper hit. The few niggles—lack of a functioning map, long load times later in the game and the fact that the game is a bit unbalanced at the beginning—never really affected my enjoyment of the game. With its engaging story and completely different skill system, it's definitely worth your while to pick it up and play.”Thumbs up – Four fat chicks“Heretic Kingdoms has pretty engaging gameplay, and grants the player a wide variety of options with which to focus their character's development.”8/10 – Glide underground												关于这款游戏							In the world of the Heretic Kingdoms, a world where God is dead and religion heresy, you are cast as a young female inquisitor, working to stamp out the last remnants of religion. On instructions to destroy a relic which the Inquisition considers to be a significant threat, you are drawn into a war between two warring secret societies – a conspiracy of mages whose goal is true power, and a shadowy cult who seeks to resurrect the Dead God.As the story progresses, you will be placed in an amoral world and left to decide your own morality. Just like the real world, your actions have consequences, and it is up to you to decide if you can live with them or not. Play as an altruistic heroine, a vicious and selfish egotist, or just a woman trying to get her job done – your actions will lead you to one of six different endings depending on where you decide your loyalties lie. Will you crush religion underfoot, or become its savior? Only you can decide!An engaging story line written by a script team lead by critically acclaimed game writer and designer Chris Bateman (Discworld Noir, Ghost Master)!Features a simple but rewarding combat system that keeps the action flowing thick and fast.A vast world to explore containing around fifty locations, scores of unique monsters, and tons of loot!
