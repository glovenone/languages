By dropping the well-tread overhead perspective and focusing on a few refined gameplay elements, it sticks to the basics and does them very, very well.”JayIsGames“It’s like they know all of my weaknesses, brewed them in a pot and when dipping the prongs in they pulled out these two games. And the stupid thing is I like them.”IndieStatik												关于这款游戏							The Tribloos 2 is the sequel to the best-selling time management game, The Tribloos.Trey's village is under threat once more.
