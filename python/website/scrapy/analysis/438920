Pay once and have fun; no boosters and no race for better items to get ahead of other players."”Gamers Sphere“Legends of Callasia hits all the right marks and is shaping up to be something really rather special indeed.”Alpha Beta Gamer“The art of the game is simple yet vibrant and resembles the maps of board games. A definite old school theme emanates from the aesthetics. The maps, cards, and portraits of heroes are all well drawn and definitely accentuate the quality of the game. The music has a medieval high-fantasy feel to it, and the sound effects of attacks and such are well done. The visuals and sounds are definitely polished and make the game feel so much better, even in the pre-beta stage.”Haogamers												关于这款游戏							The Great Callasian War rages across the lands.
