Like any other good strategy game it can take some time to find the right strategy that will suit your play style, but that process of discovery is what makes these games so enticing.”9/10 – Digitally Downloaded“Warlock II might take place in a silly universe where narrators like to impersonate Sean Connery and kingdoms are ruled by regal rats or chatting skeletons, but Ino-Co has taken its construction very seriously. It’s exactly what a sequel should be, keeping the spirit of the original but improving every aspect.”8/10 – PCGamesN“Warlock 2 is definitely a step in the right direction – it takes everything that was good about the first game, and refines it a bit, while also leaving the original experience intact.”8/10 – Strategy Informer													Previews:									Rock Paper Shotgun:http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/03/20/preview-paradox-warlock-exiled-strategy/ : "Warlock II is everything I wanted from a sequel to Masters of the Arcane..."PC Gamer:http://www.pcgamer.com/uk/previews/warlock-2-hands-on-set-fire-to-angry-dragons-in-this-cheery-turn-based-sequel/"... quirky sense of humour and a good variety of enemies, units, spells and randomised occurrences."Quill18:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpBMZKE3irc&feature=youtu.be&a“I am enjoying this very much”																						关于这款游戏							The worlds have been shattered, and you have been exiled to one of these shards.
