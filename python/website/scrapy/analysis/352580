Hidden is a very solid piece of adventuring. I look forward to what I hope will be an equally satisfying conclusion.”B+ – GameBoomers“Lostspell really makes the player have to think and earn their progression through the nightmarish story, which is one of the brilliant aspects of the game: one must remain level-headed and comprehensive, even in the face of intimidating and scary atmospheric elements.”3.5/4 – Fangoria												关于这款游戏							Immersed into dark and unexplored ancient woods a group of expeditioners goes deep in search of an old, almost forgotten legend, the "Legend of the Ancients".
