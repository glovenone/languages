To fuel continuous expansion and to quench a thirst for human mastery over its domain, a new source of energy was developed. In 2125, corporate giant GENKORP unveiled A2P, a newly discovered energy source, more powerful than anything previous created by man. While touted as completely safe and environmentally friendly, there were those who foresaw the danger of A2P and opposed its development from the beginning. This opposition gave birth to ARKANE, a rebel group bent on stopping GENKORP's plans to develop A2P.GENKORP quickly branded ARKANE a terrorist faction and an enemy of all good and upstanding citizens of the world. In control of such a powerful life-giving (and taking) source of energy, GENKORP grew into a massive private military complex, holding the key to life on earth.But very quickly A2P’s dark side manifested. Earth’s weather was altered forever, with “natural” disasters ravaging our planet, reshaping it and turning much of the world into what is now simply known as “The Dust”.Fierce endless fighting persists between GENKORP and ARKANE. Meanwhile, those that have not aligned with either faction are branded as bandits and outlaws. Loyal to neither GENKORP nor ARKANE, they fight for survival, etching a difficult existence in The Dust.																						关于这款游戏							A post-apocalyptic, turn based, tactical combat and strategy game where you lead your caravan on a quest for revenge.In a World saved and destroyed by a new energy source, a quest for revenge will unveil the deepest secret on how it all began to fall apart.Key Features Deep turn based tactical combat: Old school Action Points system, Looting within missions, melee combat and dozens of weapons to choose from and more.
