You can not control your subjects directly; instead you focus on city-building, resource management, diplomacy, heroes, magic and other things a typical king deals with on a daily basis.The game is very flexible: you can build up a powerful realm and rule the lands with an iron grip, or establish a humble fishermen's village. Or create a trading empire. Or found a small, bur well-defended outpost or raider's camp. Or become a host of a wizard's manor.All characters, from a hauler to a hero have their own minds and behavior patterns. Sometimes it is interesting just to watch people scurry about minding their own business.Implemented features:Build a medieval city;Play the game the way like it: experiment with sandbox settings or try to survive in harsh environment;Keep your people happy by providing them with necessary resources and services;Gather resources, produce goods and build industries;See reports and tune up your economy;Build an army and protect your city from monsters and invasions;Trade and conduct diplomacy with neighbor realms, or go to war with them;English and German languages with Spanish coming soon;Achievements.Planned features:Magic and religion;Heroes and quests;Better music.
