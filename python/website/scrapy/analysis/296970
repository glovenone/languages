desc_long							评测						“It's genuinely great, like, it's one of my favorite games this year so far. It's got so much going for it, so much depth, so much character, so much replayability, great systems, unique concepts in combat, awesome presentation...”TotalBiscuit, The Cynical Brit“Here’s where I start to love Renowned Explorers. The encounters aren’t just a paper/rock/scissors system of aggressive, friendly, or devious. The more pertinent choice is whether you’re going to talk or fight. Either approach has distinct rules, with some characters suited to one or the other.”100 – Quartertothree - Tom Chick“...Renowned Explorers still stands as one of the best surprises of the year so far that wannabe adventurers of any age can enjoy. Encountering some thugs but instead of fighting, it just turns into one great big insult throwing contest where the loser runs away, foaming at the mouth. Brilliant.”85 – Gamewatcher - John Paul Jones												关于这款游戏							Renowned Explorers: International Society is a strategy adventure game set in a fictitious 19th century world.
