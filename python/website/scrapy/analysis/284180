desc_long							评测						“From top to bottom it impresses, at once both fresh and fun, and suffers very few missteps along the way.”Leaderboard #5 – http://thexblig.com/2013/08/25/review-magicians-looters/“Polished. If you had to describe Magicians & Looters in one word, that would be it.”9/10 – http://www.fateofthegame.com/indie-review-magicians-looters/“This game is a testament to both sarcasm and self-awareness in RPGs.  It's really really funny.”SplatterCatGaming												关于这款游戏							High above the lame Mortal Realm rests the cloud-wreathed towers of the Wizard Keep.It is a place where robes never go out of style, and beards are totally awesome.But then the badguys attack, and Versimos is kidnapped!Luckily for Versimos, he has three students who will stop at nothing to get a passing grade, and if that means rescuing their teacher from the treacherous Morg Mountains, then so be it.Brent - Wields a sword. Kind of boring.Nyn - Wields two swords. Awesome.Vienna - Commits murder with her bare hands. Talks to cats. Doesn't wear shoes.Leveling system built around exploration, not grinding.Abridged Mode will abbreviate all the game's dialogue, keeping the focus on the action.Completionist-friendly loot system. All weapons/items have a reserved slot in your inventory and a hint as to their general location.Equipment possesses both benefits and drawbacks. Creative combinations yield the best results.
