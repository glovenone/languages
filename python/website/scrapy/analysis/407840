Harvesting ION is a dangerous task.  You must escort a hacked Harvesting drone to the desired region on the surface and protect it for the duration of its mission.

The rest of the Drone Protection Army will maintain its standing conservation policy and attack anyone harvesting ION, in addition to any enraged local wildlife.[ PLAY OR PAY ] Coming 2016ION is used as the in-game currency.  It is typically collected in-game as drops and rewards and can be used to purchase new Weapons via SkyFly Shopping, obtain new crafting ingredients OR converted to the out-of-game currency known as CREDITS which are used in the Trek Store where you can collect new Armors, Weapon Skins, Taunts, Hats and more!

The Orion Project has endless possibilities and we cannot wait to realize them.
