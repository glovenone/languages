That’s often a sign of a great central mechanic: straight forward enough for players to pick up quickly, but deep enough to allow for many puzzle possibilities. […] the central mechanic is strong enough to keep things interesting. If you’re a fan of puzzle games, Plith is definitely worth the miniscule asking price of $3.99.”Capsule Computers“I would say that the game is worth picking up, if you enjoy puzzles of this nature then it's a great game that should keep you occupied plenty...”Indie Game News“Looking to get more brain candy out of your gaming library?  Be sure to check out Plith, a puzzle game that uses connected spinning gears as it’s main mechanic.  The gameplay reminds me a bit of Cogs, another great indie puzzle game.”I-Luv-Games												关于这款游戏							Plith is an indie puzzle game for Windows and OS X. It puts gamers in a spatial setting, where they have to manage several puzzle elements (mostly gears) and must make quick decisions which can simplify or complicate their path to victory. Plith is a fast paced game which contains a lot of levels – more than 100 – to be solved. The player moves some gears and can place them on the level; some gears rotate, and transmit their rotation to the adjacent ones: the objective of each level is to activate the target gears. These levels constitute five different worlds, which are subdivided into fourteen sections. Each section introduces new gameplay elements; for example, several kinds of gears and obstacles come out along the game. The game is presented using mostly 3D graphics, with a few handmade drawings as well.Key Features: Five different worlds, which are subdivided into fourteen sections More than 100 levels Fast paced Several gameplay elements (e.g. several kinds of gears and obstacles)
