desc_long									特色列表									Our Custom Map Workshop goes LIVE on April 16, 2016. We are celebrating with a 2 week sale so come try out H-Hour and the new community maps!																						关于这款游戏							H-Hour: World's Elite™ (H-Hour) is a tactical, team-based military shooter in which cooperation among players is required for success. The game uses a Third Person perspective to enhance the player's situational awareness.  Players can see where they are in relation to the world.  This battlefield perspective encourages more strategic awareness and teamwork. In line with our vision to produce a spiritual successor to the early SOCOM series, H-Hour is primarily a one life game that encourages players to think strategically and work as a team in order to avoid waiting in the dead room until the round ends. A respawn mode is also offered. This allows for player warmups and to help new players adjust to the Third Person perspective prior to joining the community in the more punishing one life game play. Currently H-Hour includes one life and respawn game play. There are 4 maps and 5 game modes available to select from including Elimination, Demolition, Breach, Sabotage and Hostage Extraction. Players can also select from 6 different characters, change camos and dance moves and setup a variety of different loadouts for weapons and equipment to carry on the battlefield depending on the demands of a particular mode. We have also added a custom map Workshop to allow the H-Hour community to develop and share their own maps for the game (Releasing to public April 14, 2016).All characters and locations are presented in a plausible, authentic manner. The game is inspired by real world events—the personal stories of Special Operations Forces—repurposed and staged in new and equally deadly locations for the purposes of preserving national security. The art style is hyper real—photorealism is the foundation but is exaggerated to a level of vivid, dramatic tones, grittiness, and dramatic lighting in which the color palette tells as much of a story as the mission briefings. Environments emphasis all the filth, chaos, and visual disruption that is common to many of the places where savages plot and launch their insurgencies or terrorism campaigns.
