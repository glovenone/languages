desc_long								关于这款游戏							This game has 20 levels called zones and some extra experiences. At the beginning you have access to a field-training tutorial that will teach you the basics and 3 zones that you can play.As you save dolphins in each zone you will unlock access to more waypoints that you can teleport to. New waypoints will have more zones and new interactions with characters.You have the opportunity to save 3, 5, or 10 dolphins in each zone. The number of dolphins you save depends on your score. Your score is computed differently for each level but usually consists of balls through rifts, rifts hit, and/or cubes hit multiplied together.Diversity in maximizing the various components in each zone is key to getting higher scores. Your scores are compared against the tiers shown on the screen in the results scene. Check the Action Board at the beginning to see how many dolphins you’ve saved in each zone and what your next objective is.The story unfolds a little more at each new waypoint. At first the characters are focused on explaining how to play the game, but after a few waypoints the dialogue shifts to giving you insight into their world.If you are confused on how to get a higher score on a zone then read the debrief that is available on the menu before you enter the zone. Most zones require skill and practice to get familiar with what you need to do to win and many zones have an element of randomness so your experience will be slightly different each time you play.For gameplay videos of each zone check out this playlist on the Dolphin Defense Youtube Channel:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjkAgQa3vqkepcR54yMN5ulQn-aAHhAT_Theme Song LyricsCan't you seeI'm waiting for youYou and meHave so much to doIf I'm goneThe world will be a darker placeCome onGive it your allWe've got toSave the DolphinsWe've got toLa la la la love the DolphinsWe've got toLa la la la love the DolphinsCome with meWe'll save the dolphinsOne two threeNo need to be twinsIf I'm goneThe world will be a darker placeCome onGive it your allWe've got toSave the DolphinsWe've got toLa la la la love the DolphinsWe've got toLa la la la love the DolphinsSave them!Music: 'Save the Dolphins' by Tanner Thayer feat.
