Hack cameras & locked doors. Build walls for cover. Break down secret walls to discover new paths. Choose whether you are playing for the full adventure, or just a quick challenge. Edit or create your own rooms, enemies, weapons, textures, models & sounds, then share them with the world!4089: Ghost Within has 3 game modes, "Normal" mode (skill points are lost at death), "Limited Lives" mode (no skill points are lost, but you only have 4 lives) & "Permadeath" mode (you only have 1 life).Also, find out how the worlds of 3079 & 3089 connect in this sequel and decide what to do with the all powerful Overlord.Java 8 comes bundled with 4089.
