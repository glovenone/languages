desc_long								关于这款游戏							The journey of the small beneficial cell reaches its final chapter, through various wonderful microscopic worlds with one goal: to bring life to the surrounding environment by constructing and combining together beneficial bubbles to fill the whole visible fabric. In this last journey, the small cell will cross several biological worlds that represent various states of matter: Solid, Ice, Water, Gas, Plasma. During the adventure, the cell will encounter multiple enemies, random barriers and obstacles of all kinds and with different features, harmless or lethal. Our protagonist will find while traveling various bonuses that will facilitate the journey. Each level is procedurally generated, so any game scenario is always unpredictable! Objectives of the gameTo revitalize and fill the tissue underneath the small cell will use a method entirely new: the modular bubbles! By drawing, closing and joining together the microscopic filaments, the small cell will create a kind of wonderful, colorful and beneficial structure, with which it will be able to overcome the various levels. The aim of the game is to fill with organic filaments a certain percentage of the playing field. These organic filaments will create bubbles that can be joined together by means of the vertices. To pass each level you have to fill the required percentage within a time limit, paying attention to the barriers, obstacles and enemies present. Composable Bubbles Engine (CBE):This engine allows you to create multiple beneficial bubbles using vertices of existing ones.
