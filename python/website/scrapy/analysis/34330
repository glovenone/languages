It is the middle of the 16th Century in Feudal Japan. The country, once ruled by a unified government, is now split into many warring clans.  Ten legendary warlords strive for supremacy as conspiracies and conflicts wither the empire.  Only one will rise above all to win the heart of a nation as the new shogun...The others will die by his sword.						Take on the role of one Daimyo, the clan leader, and use military engagements, economics and diplomacy to achieve the ultimate goal: re-unite Japan under his supreme command and become the new Shogun – the undisputed ruler of a pacified nation.						Game Features						Total War: SHOGUN 2 features enhanced full 3D battles via land and sea, which made a name for the series, as well as the tactical campaign map that many refer to as the heart and soul of Total War. Featuring a brand new AI system inspired by the scriptures that influenced Japanese warfare, the millennia old Chinese “Art of War”, the Creative Assembly brings the wisdom of Master Sun Tsu to Total War: SHOGUN 2.
