In this, you are in a mysterious world, unfamiliar and bizarre, yet the eerily nostalgic design instills the necessary knowledge to proceed in your adventure."The Ambivalest"Sean HTCH and Joni Kittaka have made magic with this game, creating a world that I could be afraid to enter but never want to leave...The locations are vibrant and detailed, going to all manner of different places...[the music] can take the visual mood and shift it into territory that pixel art shouldn't be able to inhabit...I know we're only in February, but this has Game of the Year written all over it."Mash Those Buttons - 4.7/5"Anodyne can be as funny and charming as Link’s Awakening on occasion, but the overall tone is one of unease, with a subtle malevolence – the ‘something seems a bit off here’ factor – reminiscent of the indie horror Lone Survivor. Meaning is elusive, but themes and motifs soon begin to take form, in a game that feels increasingly personal the more you burrow into it."PC Gamer - 84/100												关于这款游戏							In Anodyne, you explore and fight your way through surreal and at times, creepy, nature, urban and abstract themed areas in the human Young's subconscious, evoked by a 16-bit-era visual style and a moody, dream-like soundtrack. Created by Sean HTCH and Joni Kittaka.They are working on Even The Ocean http://www.twitter.com/eventheocean , a new adventure platforming / hybrid walk-&-press slice-of-life adventure/daydream platforming game. It will also be released on Steam.Because this game was made by a small team, please note there is no customer support for Anodyne available at this time. We recommend the stable Mac and Windows versions. For Linux users, you may have trouble running it if not using Ubuntu. Please request a refund if you are unable to get the game to work.
