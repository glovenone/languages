Become the head of the newly established “New Space” company whose goal would be to establish a colony on Mars. You begin as a startup - develop cutting edge aerospace technologies and use them to achieve orbit and fly beyond Earth vicinity, blazing the trail of a space pioneer and leaving the competition far behind on your way to victory. Our game will achieve two goals - promote the outer space industry and satisfy all economy game fans. Race To Mars combines the realism of a spaceport management sim and approachable gameplay - we assure you that both subject aficionados and casual gamers will find this mixture most entertaining. Our priority is to make an approachable game without compromising its key economical and strategical features - says Szymon Janus, the CEO of INTERMARUM.Since we aim to deliver the best quality, we're developing the game in close cooperation with scientists from a Polish space industry company, Kosmonauta.net; and we're using Unity, the leading multiplatform game engine, thanks to this we'll be able to deliver top quality content.
