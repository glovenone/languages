As a player you build a deck of characters, skills, and equipment. During a game players play characters onto a battlefield. Then those characters maneuver around the field in turn based combat. The objective is to eliminate all of the opponent's characters from the board (or in some cases just their commander card). Cards can be gained and leveled between games. Steamalot is set in the medieval period where the development of steampunk technology has begun earlier than the traditional Victorian setting indicates. Instead of magic the populous is amazed with new intricate clockwork and steam technology. Merlin is a gifted engineer and friend to the King. Player's follow the story of Patric Epoch, Merlin's apprentice, who must help him determine the root cause behind rising disturbances in the kingdom. The game uses a combination of 16bit and cell shaded graphics.Key Features: Deck Building & Multiple Decks Single Player Campaigna Cross Platform PvP matches 42 Battlefields (one for each single player level) Card Leveling Create any card using the Fusion System
