desc_long							评测						“With a few changes, Rooftop Cop could be as fast and intense as any arcade classic, but Clark’s chosen pace favors introspection.”KILL SCREEN“Rooftop Cop is not a 'fun' game, nor is it intended to be; its purpose is to make us think, and in this succeeds very well.”Indie Vault (Italian)“Clark sees it as an invitation for us to critique ourselves as much as the authority in our lives.”KILL SCREEN												关于这款游戏							A world of Police that have forgotten what, and why, they are policing.Rooftop Cop is a collection of five endless vignette games and a 7-track album. The games are set on a loose metaphysical timeline in which the Cops slowly lose their way.Each of the five parts is quite different, and varies in theme from environmental terror, to manic industry, to a sort of darkly aloof joy. The companion album is included, and contains more than just the music from the games. (See instructions below on where to find the music after download!)______________ROOFTOP COPI: A Proud History -- balance collecting citations with an abstract deficit, looking for tiny crimesII: Capture the Flag, for One -- find and return the flag in an environment that does not have you in mindIII: The Datamines -- endlessly collect "evidence" from apartments, find places to stash it before you are crushed under its weightIV: God Bles Everyone -- amass junk and expand your raft as you drift through a flooded cityV: Palace of the Organizer -- play in the sand, check the fax machine, and re-arrange sticks on a soothing dystopian beach______________DOESN'T SPEAK, DOESN'T LISTENTo access the album:- Right-click 'Rooftop Cop' in Steam Library- Properties- 'Local Files' tab- 'Browse Local Files'- There is a zip file!
