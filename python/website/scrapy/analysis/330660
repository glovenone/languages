I believe they've succeeded.”IndieGames“What is probably most enticing is the promise that each set of levels features a unique gameplay addition or tweak that makes it feel different from the other sets.”Destructoid“If you love space and want a better idea of how it works, or just like solid and pretty puzzle games, Luna’s Wandering Stars has a lot to offer.”80/100 – Venturebeat												关于这款游戏							Take control of the powers of the cosmos.
