Your task is to take this undeveloped piece of vacuum and turn it into a tourist center/economic hub/mega-prison/diplomatic epicenter or any combination you can manage.The challenges will be many, oxygen will escape through every tiny hole in the hull, you'll contend with asteroid showers and nebulous alien blobs.
