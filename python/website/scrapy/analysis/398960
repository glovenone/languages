desc_long							评测						7/10 – The Platformer													Huge Update In The Works!									Hello everyone! I just wanted to give all of you a quick heads up about some new content coming to Hoven the Sages Spinel. There is going to be a new window outliner, some new enemies, and the first piece of DLC! Oh, and all DLC will be FREE OF CHARGE and come in the form of updates. HOWEVER, due to the amount of time and effort it take to do this, I will be increasing the price of the game to $4.99. Which I believe to be a good trade. I plan to have the update launched by the 2nd of October. Have a good one!																						关于这款游戏							Welcome to the world of Hoven!
