We’ve got lots of fantasy books, some horror books, a few modern books, but this energetic take on classic sci-fi is a breath of fresh air...”4.5/5 – Touch Arcade“...it’s a no brainer of a purchase – especially for Sci-Fi fans.”4/5 – 148 Apps													特色列表									Fully customize your entire crew, from their names, their stats – and even rename your starship!Three styles of combat: melee, phaser and even starship battles!Switch around your crew before each battle round for added strategy during combat!Beam down to strange alien planets, selecting your finest crew for the job!Auto-mapping charts your travels through the cosmos!
