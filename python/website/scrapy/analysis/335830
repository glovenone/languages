desc_long							评测						“I covered this game recently, and it had exceptional real-time strategy style combat, which made it a lot of fun. The building aspect usually found in RTS games happens in-between missions, wherein you use your found salvage to purchase new ships.”SpaceGameJunkie“It’s pretty and affectingly moody, and in its movement-heavy, explosion-littered fights involving sometimes dozens of ships it’s probably leaning more towards Gratuitous Space Battles than FTL’s static hull bombardment.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun“if you are the sort that likes to get involved with a game's development through the program, roguelikes are a great genre to play around with in Early Access as spoiling the game for yourself is much less of an issue.”Destructoid												关于这款游戏							In Distant Star: Revenant Fleet, you take control of the last remaining ships of a near-destroyed A’kari fleet, and must rebuild your forces as you battle through ancient, galactic battlefields towards a final showdown with the Orthani. Build your fleet of up to 5 ships (from a choice of any combination of 8 classes) and upgrade their weapons and attachments which give you new and improved skills to use in combat.  With hundreds of attachments to choose from, each class has many different possible loadouts.Traverse the galaxy one system at a time - each step of the way you will face unique story events, each of which has multiple outcomes that can change with each playthrough.  Choose whether or not you enter combat, flee or try to talk your way out of difficult situations - but don't think the same choice next time round will have the same outcome!Combat takes place in small tactical RTS missions that last between 5 and 30 minutes.  Enemy fleets scale to always provide a challenge for your fleet and as you progress through the game, things will get tougher still!  But don't worry, you can use Tactical Pause to issue orders to your fleet and ensure you have the upper hand in battle.All set within a beautifully designed universe with an eerily atmospheric soundtrack - Distant Star: Revenant Fleet is a game you'll be playing again and again...
