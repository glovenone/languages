While I feared it would turn out to be just another sci-fi horror adventure, it jumped up and surprised me with meaningful storytelling, interesting mysteries, and three different endings (all of which are extremely impactful, depending on what kind of psychotic person you are).”Johnny Ohm, Gizorama“The game is proof that you don't need Unreal Engine 4 visuals or graphic violence to be scary and immersive, all you need is a character, a ship and the endless void where all your dreams - and all your nightmares - can exist.”Steve Buja, Gamenguide“Spirits of Xanadu is short and sweet like any good adventure game should be. Not only does the game balance several stories in the air at the same time, it pulls you in and captivates you into all of them.”Logan Launeer, Modvive												关于这款游戏							At the farthest edge of the explored universe, the research ship Xanadu slumbers in orbit around a mysterious planet.
