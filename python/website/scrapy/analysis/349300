Bolstered by great art and voice acting, it was never boring even as I spent hours with all the tower's inhabitants, slowly but surely deciphering their back stories.”Kotaku“Jast USA have shown that there are still hidden gems to unearth in visual novels from the last decade. This is one of those gems.”A- – The Otaku Study“Not only is the magical storyline interesting but the cast of distinct characters really bring the world to life. This is counterbalanced by a surprisingly addictive gameplay system which pairs luck with strategy in order to take on tons of quests. In absence of adult content, the game still stands tall as both its storyline and gameplay are excellent. There’s no need to lure players in with sexuality, unlike some other titles.”4.5/5 – HardcoreGamer												关于这款游戏							StoryWelcome to Stella Mundo, a magical world still recovering from the devastation of the Mage War that ended the Age of Towers.Domino, the youngest wizard ever to earn the rank of Archmage, has just begun his study of the ancient Dark Tower, a treasure trove of lost magical knowledge.But there’s a catch.As its price for allowing him access to the tower, the corrupt Council of Archmagi has assigned Domino two gifted but troublesome students - Aria, the daughter of a noble family, and Kaya, an orphan with an unusual heritage - and given him just three years to complete their training, a process that normally takes decades.GameplayAs Domino, you must mentor Aria and Kaya in their training to become witches, mastering the magical arts.
