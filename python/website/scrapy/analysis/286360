desc_long							评测						“Shadows on the Vatican makes a promising debut with Act I: Greed and advertises its potential well by setting up a complex, controversial story; creating a tidy, streamlined world that matches the gravity of the plot; and incorporating an engaging cast of characters.”Adventure Gamers“Shadows On the Vatican – Act I: Greed is a wonderful opening to this four part episodic point and click adventure game. The voice acting and soundtrack is amongst the best I’ve heard in a long time – which is all the more impressive as this game is made by a small Italian company most of you reading this have never heard of.”Diehard Game Fan“It’s definitely a very good title to play not only for the adventure games lovers, but even for who is not into this genre, since it features the simplicity of a very intuitive technical compartment, cleverly mixed with an intricate and worthy plot, which prefigures a compelling ending since the beginning. The Vatican will swallow you, leaving your mouth watering.”Tiscali Gamesurf												关于这款游戏							Visiting Rome from Chicago, where he works as a doctor, ex-priest James Murphy answers a mysterious call for help from his friend Cristoforo. The disappearance of a briefcase containing compromising documents is enough to convince James that his friend is a victim of something shady and sinister. The Vatican's involvement and some strange parallels with his own traumatic past inspire James to get to the bottom of this mystery. Along this dangerous and disturbing path, James finds the most unlikely travelling companion who will question his deepest beliefs. And so the two characters begin both a physical journey in search of the truth, and a metaphysical exploration of the inner soul and the darkest secrets that everyone hides, even a "champion of the faith" like James. Rome is the stage for this adventure – a city bathed in eternal twilight, its skies tinted the color of blood spilled in more than thirty years of intrigue: blood of innocents and guilty, unknown and famous victims alike.KEY FEATURESShadows on the Vatican is a thrilling new point-and-click adventure in 4 acts, inspired by real events in recent Italian history and freely adapted from the bestseller of David Yallop "In God's Name".
