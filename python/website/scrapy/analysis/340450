Play it with the autopilot off though”Bennett Foddy												关于这款游戏							Outwit gravity, race the clock, explore new worlds.Crashed lander is a gravity-based arcade game inspired by classics like Lunar Lander and Space Taxi. You've built a janky craft out of propane tanks and spare parts. Pilot it  from pad to pad trying to beat your best time – then flirt with that fine line between speed and control. If you’re brave enough to try Hard Mode you’ll be flopping around like a QWOPy, low gravity turtle. With a little practice you’ll be zippin' around doin' barrel rolls. You’ll see sites from the cutting edge of fractal mathematics – bizarre, organic shapes, arcane archaeological digs, and all manner of WTFderful alien vistas. Each level is a detailed hand-crafted environment that encourages the player to explore - and goof around! You can also pilot your lander in virtual reality with your Oculus Rift. 25 levels to conquer and explore in pad Hopper mode20 levels in Ring Runner mode - fly through custom coursesFull Oculus Rift support - including a version for runtime 1.3.
