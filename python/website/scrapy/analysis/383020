About the developerHi, I'm Ludvig Larsson, a Swede in France and creator of Mindoki games.I have always been attracted to the video game universe and quickly I understood that gaming wasn't the only thing I liked so I started my career as a game developer and game designer in Paris.After ten years programming and designing video games (Quest for alliance, Ghost force, Speed Addict underground, Bubble Soccer, plus another 15-20) I decided to go indie so I worked in the classic industry daytime and in the rest of the time on my games: Mindoki (which is now my company name but was a fully working 3D MMORPG), Metamorphes.com (a turnbased web-MMO), a lot of prototypes..., and finally, a Family of Grave Diggers.As the game came along nicely, I decided to go full time indie (since April 2015) and it works really well!• Release datesBarring disasters, the full release is planned for Q1 2016• Contact informationLudvig Larsson aka ValmondMain web page: http://www.mindoki.com/Mail: team@mindoki.comBlog: http://hubot.mindoki.com/wordpress/Twitter: https://twitter.com/MindokiGamesSteam: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=345273517
