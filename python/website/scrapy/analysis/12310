desc_long								关于这款游戏							The World Union is labeled the 'perfect society'. Prosperity is a science, disease and wars have vanished, sex is entertainment, and the future has never looked brighter. Suddenly this perfect society is rocked by the murder of a World Union citizen in the 'Rogue State' of Russia. His murder oddly coincides with the accidental death of a prominent professor in Adrianopolis, an important border town between the World Union and Russia. This career making case is assigned to a young woman, Phoenix Wallis who as the Senior Peace and Security staff officer has been assigned to lead the murder investigation. Her search for the truth leads to enigmatic clues, and deepening mysteries that challenge not only her case, but her very belief in the world she has sworn to protect.
