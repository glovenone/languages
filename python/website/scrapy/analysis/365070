Is one man able to accomplish this? Is there more to his team's relationships other than business? Can everything in a translator's life be simple and clear? Girls in swimsuits. Everyone likes girls in swimsuits! Unique graphics, story, music. All was made especially for this game. Four endings: 2 bad endings, one normal and one good. Two languages: English and Russian. Achievements: To get all 12 achievements you need to play about an hour or two.
