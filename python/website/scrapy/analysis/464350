desc_long									Why subscription?									Screeps is an unusual MMO game that has no counterparts at the moment. There are numerous online games where your character exists in the game world only while you’re online and disappears after you exit the game. There are fewer games that have your character or units continue some defined automatic activity even after logging out. But only Screeps runs your scripts in full continuously, on the 24/7 basis, and you are allowed to use them for anything JavaScript allows. This makes Screeps more like a hosting or cloud computing service rather than a traditional online game. We offer you server CPU time and fixed amount of memory that you can use as you wish (though it’s still preferable to use it in relation with the game!). Though a new player gets a quite low initial CPU limit, after upgrading your game level you can end up with your limit up to 300 ms per game tick which is quite a serious hosting asset. As we designed the game, we were considering numerous options and finally came to a conclusion that justification of such expenses requires only one model: game time (or, in our case, CPU time) subscription. And note that we don’t offer multiple subscription options: the subscription cost is the same for all players. Thus we avoid creating game advantages for certain groups of players since all are provided with equal opportunities to use server resources. If you don’t wish to use such resources on general terms, you can just confine yourself to purchasing a starter kit on Steam. A minimum 10 CPU amount will be reserved for you on the server, but it won’t grow following your game level. Such a mode is not suitable for a full competitive playing but is still enough for those who are fine with 2-3 game rooms in the game world to have some fun of the game. In the future, as we make the local hosted server available, the Steam copy of the game will also be required to connect to such unofficial game worlds.																						关于这款游戏							Screeps is about scripting your creeps. It is a MMO RTS sandbox game for programmers, wherein the core mechanic is programming your units AI. With all the attributes of a full-fledged strategy game, you control your colony by writing real JavaScript which operate 24/7 in the single persistent world filled by other players on par with you.Your colony can harvest resources, build units, conquer territory, trade with another colonies. As you conquer more territory, your influence in the game world grows, as well as your abilities to expand your footprint. However, it requires a lot of effort on your part, since multiple players may aim at the same territory.Screeps is developed for people with programming skills. Unlike some other RTS games, your units in Screeps can react to events without your participation – provided that you have programmed them properly. And, unlike other MMO, you do not have to play Screeps constantly to play well. It is quite enough just to check once in a while to see if everything goes well.Features: You play by writing JavaScript AI which controls your units 24/7 even while you're offline. No shards, game realms and session match-ups: units of all players coexist in the same real-time persistent world and obey the same rules. Units, base, mining resources, territory control, economy, manufacturing, transporting, logistics, trading – all the attributes of a real strategy game which you need to program! The better your scripts, the better your game — irrespective of the time played. Your creeps will mine, build, defend, and conquer as you just work, sleep, or walk your dog. Only basic programming skills are required. However, if you are a pro developer, now is the chance to put your skills to the limit! Edit your scripts from the in-game editor, or using your favorite external IDE. Lifetime MMO access with 10 CPU limit included in the starter package. Raise your CPU limit to the point depending on your game level by purchasing a CPU subscription plan or via in-game items called Gametime Tokens. The subscription cost is the same for all players, there is no way to pay more to gain more advantages. Open source game server engine, and an option to create your own local world and play with friends without limits or subscriptions (not available yet, please read the Early Access notes).
