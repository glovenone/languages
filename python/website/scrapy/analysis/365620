desc_long								关于这款游戏							WarBirds 2016 availability begins September 28th, 2015!  This update to the world famous WarBirds, Combat Flight Simulation, in its 20th year, has 4 new aircraft, 10 new terrains and new flight models for 22 aircraft.  The online version of WarBirds now has the S3 Historical Events beginning on Sept 13th and going through June 2016, new Combined Arms arenas, and a new Advanced Flight Model Arena for veteran pilots.  If you don't have WarBirds, now is the time to get this great WWII aviation combat simulator. If you have purchased WarBirds 2015 you will be updated automatically, at no additional cost.WarBirds can be played either in single player "solo" mode with computer-controlled enemies, or online with human and computer-controlled allies and opponents.Single player WarBirds offers over 20 flight training modules, 12 instant action missions from Bomber Ambush to Rear Gunner action, and a Free Flight mode where the player can pick from 5 different combat game modes, from Air to Air, Free Flight, Target Drones, Bomber Ambush, or Ground Attack in one of over 15 geographic terrains, and choose to fly one of over 120 aircraft and ground vehicles. Gamers choose one of three levels of pilot expertise: Rookie, Veteran, or the highly skilled Ace. In each air battle the player can score points, build rank and acquire medals on the road to the coveted title of WGFP, "Worlds' Greatest Fighter Pilot!" Online WarBirds is free to purchasers of the Steam version of WarBirds. Online you can sign up for personal training with WarBird's corps of flight instructors, compete in air-to-air action against other real players in online combat and join online squadrons. Go on raids with squadron mates and participate in special events that reenactment many of the great battles of World War II. More information about the WarBirds online community is available at http://www.Totalsims.com. In addition, for no charge, all WarBirds Online players have access to a Teamspeak 3 server. This allows online players to use voice communication within the game. While WarBirds Online is free, IENT is a business, so of course there are limitations. During the first month online you have complete access to all features at no charge. After the first month, you can still play free, but you are limited to an early war plane set, which varies from arena to arena. To access the full set of all aircraft in all arenas, Steam players can purchase day, week or month passes, which range from $2.99 to $15.95. If you just want to play in a specific event on a specific day, the Day Pass is best for you. If you want to play with the best planes, against the best players, whenever you want, the Month Pass is your best choice.WarBirds 2016 continues to dedicate itself entirely to remarkable historical accuracy and detail. After 20 years it is still one of the most impressive WWII combat flight simulations available. Choose from countless online scenarios, modes and options that give WarBirds a stunningly deep playing experience. Pick from an array of WWII aircraft and vehicles (even tank battles occur if you want to jump in and participate), each with entirely unique combat characteristic and personality, making each plane a new experience. Salute and Check Six!
