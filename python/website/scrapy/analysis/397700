It also handles many secrets, hidden warriors and hidden gems.Urizen Shadows of the Cold revolves around a beautiful, ancient, and magical world dedicated to peace, prosperity and love. Yet it wasn't always like this. Many centuries before, the world of Urizen upheld a war between the good of it's people and the dark cold race of beings who inhabited the cold regions of Urizen. This cold evil race of beings where led by Draconan, king of the Darkthrone. The King of Urizen who was then Urek would not stand to see his world he so much loved, cast in flames, and so it was done. Draconan was soon encased in stone with magic and might but this was only the beginning. After centuries of peace and prosperity the secret evil race of the cold steadily pieced themselves with an army of evil so powerful it overtook the then old Urek. With his blood they revived Draconan and overtook the army of Urizen and set Urizen in flames. All was gone except for the one they named Merciless or Merk... as the one son of Urek, Merk, overtook control and vowed to bring the land to it's rightful throne.
