desc_long							评测						“I have nothing but absolute love for it now”High – Achievement unlocked“it's a bit like a fast-paced version of Zelda for NES or SNES, but with more magical attacks”High – Game Radar“I have been looking around a long time to find surch a game. The music is great and the scenario well made. I can recommand this game to all classic Action-RPG fans”8.7 – IndieDB												关于这款游戏							Old-school Action-RPG. The fall of gods is an indie game humbly inspired by Action-RPG you used to play on 16-bit consoles (zelda, secret of mana, alundra...)It was played by more than 75’000 gamers on PC and Xbox so far...The gods and their Magic are gone long ago, and everything was left but a prophecy : “From the Darkness shall rise the Light, From the Light shall rise the Darkness”.Since then, every 16 years old boy has to challenge the "Sanctuary", as it’s said that Magic will be back with the One who would defeat its Beast.Your hero will take part in the prophecy and find the true meaning of the "Fall of Gods", the story about the Genesis of the World, and perhaps, more about his lost mother.The Fall of Gods is a traditional indie old-school action-rpg, where you could revive your favorite 16bit titles, but with more magic, and orchestral musics.- Made with XNA-Geex Engine -If you like to defeat dungeons, collect & swap items, fight with different weapons, cast spells, wear armors, rafting, hidden spots, puzzles, drive balloon, brew potions, side-quests, fairy fountains, a sense of irony, and of course, if you like to save the World ?Then you will like The fall of gods- For chapter 1 gamers  -The chapter 1 ended with the death of the hero...Now see how the story ends and play the full gameWatch out ! Chapter 1 has been improved with more features and more about the story :-)
