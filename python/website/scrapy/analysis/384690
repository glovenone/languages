desc_long								关于这款游戏							Note!: This is Umihara Kawase, one game in the Umihara Kawase Trilogy. It is based on the original SNES game. Below is a description of the entire trilogy.Easy to play, difficult to master, the Umihara Kawase Trilogy is a collection of three physics-based puzzle/platformer games with over 20 years of gaming history. Developed by the creators of the original game (Kiyoshi Sakai and Toshinobu Kondo), this cult classic was a Japanese indie smash hit!Umihara Kawase is the name of our backpacking, Japanese, sushi chef heroine armed with a fishing rod, elastic fishing line, and a fishing hook. Face fish-like enemies, conveyor belts, spikes, watery pits, time travel and more. Collect items, and find your way to the end of each level. The deeper into this dream-like world that you venture, the more challenging the solutions and the greater the time pressure becomes. Along the way, look out for shortcuts and secret exits, and unlock bonus levels.The elasticity of Umihara’s fishing line sets the Umihara Kawase Trilogy apart from other games, giving unprecedented levels of mobility and discovery. Tightening the line or giving lots of slack can be the difference between success or failure. The elastic nature of the fishing line allows the player to stretch down to otherwise unreachable areas or be catapulted upwards.Trilogy FeaturesPhysics-based puzzle/platforming that challenges your reflexes and brainpowerExtreme elastic fishing-line physics give you advanced controlMany stages with branching paths across three complete gamesSteam Workshop support in all three games for sharing replaysFour playable characters (in Sayonara Umihara Kawase)Face giant, aquatic bosses like a tadpole, a seahorse, and moreSteam Achievements, Trading Cards, Leaderboards, and Cloud SavingFull Steam controller support for all three games (optional)

desc_short	-----								Umihara Kawase is a girl who uses a fishing hook as a grappling hook. You’ll need quick reflexes to swing your way through the branching surreal environments. Use your brains to figure out the best way through. They say fish is brain food—you’re going to need it!
