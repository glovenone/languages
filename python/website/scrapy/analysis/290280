desc_long								关于这款游戏							You were on the way to a recycling process when fortunately for you - and unfortunately for the environment - you accidentally ran off. Now your goal is to escape from the facility, which is an extremely difficult task due to the fact that you are a battery without legs. Equipped with a limited number of electric beams, you can connect to walls, move or destroy objects, turn switches, and charge generators. You also have the ability to jump or push off the walls - the rest is up to physics and gravity.Key features:- puzzle platformer with a lot of explosions- over 60 levels divided into 4 industrial-themed zones- boss stages- unlockable 12-bit levels- unlockable batteries- unlimited lives !
