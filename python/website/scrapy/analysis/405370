desc_long								关于这款游戏							Humanity is threatened. A deadly virus awoke, and it is spreading quickly.	The particular flora of Arcania, a planet used to prepare humans for space colonization, may help in the creation of a cure. But it is now abandoned since working mechas turned against humans.A group of researchers is sent to this planet to find a solution. You are one of them.But as you arrived, your spaceship crashed…Hack and command mechasMechas are wild and are used to living in the storm. You must fight some of them for your survival, but they are often stronger than you are. Your best chance of survival is to hack some of those mechas and use them as allies to defeat the others.EvolveThe more combats you win, the more fragments you earn. They can be used to evolve your mechas' strength and skills. But you can also find some during exploration.Your character can also improve its capabilities.The TempestThe weather is an important threat. You must face lightning strikes, tornadoes, and other elements in order to make your way through the storm. You will be able to activate old installations used to ionize the air and stop the tempest within an area. And thankfully an old station above the clouds, left over by humans, provides good shelter.The SpaceshipYou have access to your spaceship early in the game, but you do not have enough fuel to leave the planet.It is impossible to land within the tempest, but once you have unlocked some weather controllers, you will be able to travel quickly over the map and save a lot of time.Collect, build and craftFind several resources along the journey and use them to craft useful items. You can also decide to create a greenhouse directly inside your station if you want to grow and farm plants by yourself.
