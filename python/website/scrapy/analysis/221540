It is an insight of the concepts and variable directions that the team explored during the game's creation. The journey in visual exploration is a winding and strange path at times. This book revisits that journey, come along and enjoy it. THE MAKING OF DEFENSE GRID 2 brings you behind-the-scenes of the creation of a modern video game. Over nearly two years and hundreds of hours of interviews, veteran video game journalist Russ Pitts (Polygon, The Escapist) has been given total access to every stage of development, and dives deep into the technological innovation, creative artistry and hard-nosed business that combine over weeks, months and years to make a game. From moments of startling inspiration to times of crushing stress, the author has been present for every aspect of production — major milestones, critical beta tests and sometimes contentious design meetings. THE MAKING OF DEFENSE GRID 2 is based on the article series written by Pitts for Polygon, with expanded interviews and never-before-seen material. The result is a look unlike any other into the hidden world of game development and the high stakes gamble of making games. A MATTER OF ENDURANCE:   Written by two-time Hugo award winning author Mary Robinette Kowal and performed by the English cast, A Matter of Endurance is an audio play staring the characters from Defense Grid: Containment (AI General Fletcher, AI General Cai, and Commander Simon Ritter) and introduces Maralon’s Governor Teydell as you (the Commander) and your AI companions journey from the destruction on Maralon to the destination of the Outer Colonies where the events of DG2 take place.  																						关于这款游戏							Defense Grid 2, DG2, is the highly-anticipated sequel to Hidden Path Entertainment’s 2008 Defense Grid: The Awakening.
