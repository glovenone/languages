The future is strange and amazing!”Rickyjj, Oculus Subreddit“All of this works so well that I honestly had no way of telling who was in the office next to me and who was in another city altogether. Above all else, it pervades the sense of presence that all virtual reality experiences so desperately try to capture.”David Jagneaux, Motherboard“A clever combination of head-tracking and spatial audio invited me to look directly at other players when they spoke. It felt comfortable. Natural. Easy. Before long, I started to forget about the odd combination of robots and taverns and started to just enjoy hanging out with other people in VR.”Sean Buckley, Engadget												关于这款软件							Share experiences with other people in virtual reality!
