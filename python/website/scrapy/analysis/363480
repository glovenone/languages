desc_long								关于这款游戏							Grave Prosperity: Redux follows Amber Ridge as she finds herself broken down on a mountain road. Without any reception and no signs of passers-by, she is forced to walk to the nearest town- Prosperity. A place that knows no God and exists only to make you suffer. Utilize a deadly arsenal of agility, blade-work and gun-play to fend off the darkness that stalks your every movement. Collect EXP through solving puzzles and slaying grotesque creatures in order to upgrade your stats to better suit you survival needs.** This game is no longer under development, and no longer for distribution by its creator. The patch that was being worked on for this title has been made into another game entirely called "City of Amber." Progress on its development can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/City-of-Amber-108073936245507/ **
