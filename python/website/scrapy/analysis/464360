There’s space combat, adventure gaming, open exploration stuff, a nice soundtrack and some solid pixel art.”Kotaku“Overall, 3030 Deathwar Redux is way out of this world.  For a pixelated game with a bumpin’ soundtrack, detailed artwork, complex economy mechanics, decent combat system, and a seemingly infinite number of quests to keep you busy, this game is a MUST HAVE for any space adventure lover!”Brutalgamer“You can tell I'm really enjoying this! ... This is vastly improved (over the original).”Scott Manley												关于这款游戏							3030 Deathwar Redux is an Open World 2D Space Adventure with a twist!A dead body is found by his crew, then his new ship gets impounded by the cops, something is going on... probably related to a missing freighter with a large cargo of gold bars.  Now, John Falcon, a freewheeling space pilot, tries to get back on his feet. But where to start? * Take on some local delivery jobs and get a better ship? * Downsize to a Jetsuit and go shooting space-junk for quick money? * Focus on finding the missing gold shipment before the local gangs and salvage teams?* Go punch that damn mechanic who sold you a stolen ship?               ...and what is this mysterious 'Taoist' group you keep hearing about?Maybe just take a break and go travelling inter-stellar, in an Open World of more than 30 star systems.  Features * Open world space exploration and frantic combat with afterburners blazing * Board Stations, visit the bars and talk to an array of space scum* Ghostly Derelict Ships to find on your Star-Map, spacewalk into, and salvage valuables* Large variety of fun Jobs and Missions, with exciting Side Quests* Diverse ships to buy and upgrade for Performance, Defence and Combat* Get a fuel-scoop and refuel from the corona of a sun without frying yourself!* Find Pirate Stations & begin a life of crime, attack innocent traders, steal cargo from traffic* Get a large cargo ship and go Asteroid Mining for metals, or haul Goods between systems * Hidden wormhole shortcuts, Comets, Unique Stations and other secrets to find* An intriguing Main Plot Line...  and much, much more!The Redux version adds: an extended adventure, with extra characters and side quests, space races, lots of graphical enhancements, balancing and gameplay changes, a smoother tutorial and tons of other improvements!Credits Developed by Matt Griffiths & Mic Newsam Additional Design by Max Dohme Published by Crunchy Leaf Games
