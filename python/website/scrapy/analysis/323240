desc_long								关于这款游戏							The World IIPurchasing your own team was one thing, defeating giant monsters, making money, and running the whole damn thing is another. It’s all up to you team leader!    Your Team is almost penniless and only has one hero. As the team in the biggest city of Teros, you must grow the team by having heroes quest against the biggest monsters of the land, growing your prestige and pocketbook with each win, or growing the coffers by having your team go out and work menial jobs for the day.     The more you build, the more heroes will become available you, increasing the growth of your team and allowing more experience to help heroes battle future bosses. Players have the chance to fight the meanest, baddest, and biggest bosses in gaming from the moment they enter the game in a 3D destructible arena. Players will no longer have to fight smaller enemies and trek long hours to get to a raid boss like in most Games. Can you meet the challenge?	30 different missions	8 giant monsters to battle 	Destructible arenas	3 different hero types 	No mini-monsters. Giant bad- bosses EVERYWHERE! 	Ability to play as the monsters						
title	 The World II (Hunting BOSS)
