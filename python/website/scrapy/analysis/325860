The change in purpose and limited tower placement forces you to be more strategic, especially if you're aiming for a three-star rating. The difficulty is just right, and so is the length, which is long enough to give the game value without overstaying its welcome. Fat Chicken is definitely a game worth checking out, even if you're a casual fan of the genre.”8/10 – WorthPlaying“More than just another tower defense title, the unique features and creative take on the genre have built a solid, highly-addictive game with simple, intuitive in-game controls that keep the action moving.”4/5 – TWINFINITE“Fat Chicken is very fun yet challenging. We’ve enjoyed it thoroughly and couldn’t find anything really to complain about.”5/5 – GAMING CYPHER												关于这款游戏							Fatten up the herds and rake in the cash - a REVERSE TOWER DEFENSE game where you build a factory farm armed to the udders with towers that provide feed and water to the oncoming herds of farm animals.
