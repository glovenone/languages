But I would go as far as saying this was pretty much one of the best VR gaming experiences I’ve ever had”Engadget“Jeeboman is a very good looking title, relying upon familiar science-fiction neons and metallics for its environments but incorporating a unique style for enemy design....A wonderful adaptation of familiar videogame mechanics to VR, Jeeboman deserves far more attention than it has received thus far.”VRFocus												关于这款游戏							Play as Jeeboman in this fast paced retro arcade shooter built ground up for room scale VR. Save your city from waves of invading robots and dish out destruction with a full arsenal of futuristic weaponry.Jeeboman has at his disposal 5 unique high powered weapons.
