I definitely recommend giving this game a chance.”Capsule Computers“Bad Bots lives up to everything it claims to be: A retro, 2D side scrolling shooter, which brings up nostalgia while maintaining excellent gameplay and graphics. When you have a solid game like this, time flies while you’re killing bots and trying to save the world.”Gaming Shogun“From the first second I turned the game on until the last moment I had with the campaign mode, I had fun... I would recommend the game to anyone.”4/5 – Operation Rainfall												关于这款游戏							As Sam McRae, last surviving member of the “Titan Hauler” crew, you must hack and blast your way through an onslaught of truly bad 'bots to find a way to prevent a potential planet-destroying catastrophe.
