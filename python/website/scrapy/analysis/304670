It’s easy to play, quick to jump into and loads of fun.”Brian Rubin, SpaceGameJunkie“Aeon Command is a surprisingly in-depth strategy game despite it being easy to play.  I found myself playing match after match, just so I could throw points into my fleet upgrades to see how much of a difference it makes.”8/10 – Vince Paone, Dads Gaming Addiction												关于这款游戏							The three factions of the Aeon Nebula have broken out into war.
