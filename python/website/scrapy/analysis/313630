It is a massive 16 hour experiences with miles and miles worth of world to explore, and provided you have a powerful machine (980 and up) you can experience it with some of the most ambitious high end graphics tried in VR to date.TSP is not a pure VR game. It was designed for non-VR gameplay and thus a VR headset is in no way required to play the game.
