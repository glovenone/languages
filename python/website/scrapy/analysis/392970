The story was intriguing and captivating and kept us on the edge of our seats right from the beginning to the end. Moreover, the fantastic plot is accompanied by some amazing cutscenes, flawless character animations and solid voice-overs.  The production of New York Mysteries: High Voltage is also praiseworthy. The game takes place in the famous New York City and most of the locations in the game are real-life locations. Thus, the game feels pretty real - which is a breath of fresh air considering the amount of all the fantasy titles we have been getting lately. Besides, the graphics are also sharp and clean, while the soundtracks are fitting for the theme.”4.5/5 – All About Casual Game												关于这款游戏							New York City, sometime in the 1950s.
