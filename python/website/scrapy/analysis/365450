desc_long							评测						“It’s the closest thing to a real life hacking sim I’ve ever seen”Kotaku“The idea itself owes a lot to the likes of Uplink. But it’s the execution that makes Hacknet great”Rock, Paper, Shotgun“Probably the coolest game I'll play all year. Not even kidding.”Digital Chumps													Updated Roadmap									Here is the roadmap for the new content and updates I am working on..LocalisationLocalisation is now complete for French, German, Spanish, Russian, and Korean. We’re hoping to add more languages and if you are eager to help with translating, please let me know on matt [@] hacknet-os.com!Expansion I’m well under way with the expansion DLC and am super excited about the way it’s going. The expansion will be integrated into the existing game adding around 3-5 hours of gameplay, some interesting new programs, tonnes of new computers, servers, contracts, and some hidden surprises along the way. We’re planning to sell the DLC for US$5 and expect it to launch in late 2016.Mod Support  I now have a prototype system that will allow modders to create and share Hacknet stories and custom missions easily. These tools are currently being tested by a select group of modders and game developers. We plan to launch mod support for free alongside the launch of the DLC expansion in late 2016.Multiplayer many people in the community have been asking for multiplayer and I’m experimenting with various models for this. I've got some pretty crazy ideas, and this is something that I will be exploring and releasing later this year as a free update. -Matt																						关于这款游戏							Hacknet is an immersive, terminal-based hacking simulator for PC. Dive down a rabbit hoIe as you follow the instructions of a recently deceased hacker, whose death may not have been the accident the media reports. Using old school command prompts and real hacking processes, you’ll solve the mystery with minimal hand-holding and a rich world full of secrets to explore.Bit, a hacker responsible for creating the most invasive security system on the planet, is dead. When he fails to reconnect to his system for 14 days, his failsafe kicks in, sending instructions in automated emails to a lone user.  As that user, it’s up to you to unravel the mystery and ensure that Hacknet-OS doesn't fall into the wrong hands.Exploring the volatile nature of personal privacy, the prevalence of corporate greed, and the hidden powers of hackers on the internet, Hacknet delivers a true hacking simulation, while offering a support system that allows total beginners get a grasp of the real-world applications and commands found throughout the game.FeaturesReal HackingBased on actual UNIX commands, Hacknet focuses on real hacking, not the Hollywood-style version of it. This creates a truly immersive experience and puts players right in the thick of trying to break through the firewalls.Unlock the mystery of BitA hacker is dead and the media reports don’t add up. When you are contacted by his “ghost” - an automated failsafe system - you’re drawn into the dark and murky world of underground hackers.Full immersionYou are thrust into a persistent virtual world with no “levels” or obvious game elements to break the illusion. Follow the guidance of the emails from Bit or just dive down the rabbit hole, chasing down clues and snippets of information you find as you explore different systems.Accessible but uncompromisingWhilst not holding your hand or dumbing down, the design of the game and the learning curve enables those with no prior terminal experience to enjoy it whilst delighting those in the know.Killer tunesHack to the beat of a soundtrack featuring underground artists including Carpenter Brut (Hotline Miami) and Remi Gallego (AKA The Algorithm).Soundtrack produced in association with The Otherworld Agency.
