YamaYama is bonkers.”IndieHangover“A game that is a treasure box of fun waiting to be discovered.”Geek Culture												关于这款游戏							**DISCLAIMER**This game is still in development, currently does not have single player nor online multiplayer and we strongly recommend using controllers. This is a 2-4 player local-party game.YamaYama is a whacky party game where you complete all sorts of mini-games to collect points on your path to victory. Most of the game modes utilise the FatSuit mechanic, where characters blow out and push other players away. It is made with easy-to-learn controls, so you can play with both video game veterans and newbies. The game is functional, but we decided to release on Early Access for many reasons - please read "Why Early Access?" for an in-depth on the decision. Although we haven‘t decided on a final release price, we are certain that it will not be lower than the Early Access price. But what will the build right now bring you?•	2-4 player local multiplayer•	21 game modes•	5 characters•	An excellent new game for the party!Ever since we had a running prototype of YamaYama, we've been getting playtesters to play the game and give us honest opinions and pitch ideas. This has been incredibly valuable to us in the development process, and we want to continue that work. With the Early Access, we hope and will actively encourage players to give us feedback. Tell us what you feel is bad, what is good and tell us what you‘d like to see in the game. We‘re hoping to add a bunch of new game modes, before our final release next fall – and we want you to have a say! Any ideas that end up in the game will be acknowledged and the person will be credited in the credits list of the game.To do this, we will run a forum for everyone who buys a copy of the game. There we will read every single post and take note off your feedback. We will run polls off of the feedback to ask what we should spend our powder on to add/detract/fix in the game next. As well as the forum, we will have a feedback sheet which can be accessed from the game itself, which players can choose to answer or not. By the end of the early access process, next fall, we hope to offer:•	2-4 player local AND online multiplayer•	A bunch of game modes•	10+ unique characters•	The perfect game for the party!Apart from this we will work on improving all the art and add maps.•	Online multiplayer•	New characters•	Improving art in environment•	New „micro machines-esque“ gamemode•	Items•	www.lumenoxgames.com	•	www.facebook.com/LumenoxGames•	www.twitter.com/LumenoxGames•	Join the Discussions if you have any questions!
