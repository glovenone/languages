desc_long								关于这款游戏							Celia's QuestThis is a story of a beginning. This is a story of a girl's journey to save her friend, prove herself, and maybe kick some bandit butt while doing so. This is the story of the birth of a heroine the world has never seen before. This is the story of Celia's first quest.Not long after Celia leaves her home to go on an adventure (and maybe, just maybe, to avoid getting married to Ced the creep) she finds herself in the village of Villageville, where she meets another runaway. Just as they are deciding to go search for adventure together, a group of remarkably rude bandits show up and kidnap Celia's new friend! Now it's up to Celia to save her friend, prove herself to the villagers in Villageville, and beat up all kinds of strange creatures living in the Valley.Brawl, bomb and magic your way through hordes of enemies ranging from the almost-peaceful Angry Shrooms to the devastating Dragon Dragon! Meet new friends and companions like Guy the almighty fairy, an old man that's absolutely not a retired hero, pirates, bandits and an immortal mouth in a jar!

Forgoing classic level-up systems, Celia's Quest delivers player progression through Powerups spread throughout the world. This way the player is rewarded for exploring and solving puzzles rather than being patient. Celia's Quest focuses on enjoyment rather than an epic storyline or super dramatic monologues, and shies away from anything close to mature or grimdark. It is, simply put, a fairy tale. This fairy tale has many humorous moments and though it gets serious at times it's more of a comedy than a drama. Characters are over the top, enemies are silly and the world kind of makes sense... sometimes. Did you know dungeon waters are deeper than regular water? Did you also know that this is why dungeon water chooses to only reflect more profound things, such as stars?
