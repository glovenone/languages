desc_long							评测						“Entertaining futuristic aerial action, and a good value at the price.”79 – PC Gamer“A fairly average shooter that doesn't really add much to its prequel. Vast but standard plot and sub-standard gameplay make for an interesting distraction but a generally uninspiring title.”76 – PC Gameworld“Without a gripping story line you're more likely to come back to this every once in a while when you feel like a quick zip around in a magnificent flying machine. Worthy of a look if you own a joystick or have played this type of game with your trusty mouse.”70 – IncGamers													A new part of Montezuma available on Steam!									http://store.steampowered.com/app/443370																						关于这款游戏							You are a pilot in the government forces stationed at one of the planets under attack. As you get higher on your career ladder, you will be able to choose more advanced hovercrafts and ammunition, as well as to order your own squad and influence local battles.The goal of the development of the game is to further expand our virtual universe. Based on the huge success of the first game, we are presenting you with the same world, occurring at the same time, but from the point of view of another character, whose adventures unfold according to a different storyline. At times, it will cross the storyline of the previous game, and if you have played "Echelon", you will recognize some places and characters.Echelon: Wind Warriors is a unique game. This is not a regular space-battle simulator, nor is it a simulator of combat in enclosed labyrinths. The action is taking place above the surfaces of a planet, the picturesque landscapes of which are one of the basic features of the game play. In the realism of the implementation of the gaming environment – the cockpit of the battle hovercraft – Echelon is comparable with the best flight simulators. The game play is similar to that of the MechWarrior series, but instead of a walking robot, you pilot a fighter. Echelon: Wind Warriors has the following advantages over Echelon:Unique combination of flight simulation and action.Realistic and highly detailed world of the game. Various, elaborate, and vast landscapes.A broad but well-balanced range of available weapons provides the player enough freedom and flexibility for using different tactics.The player’s progress, as he advances through the game, upgraded equipment, as well as the appearance of new equipment with unknown functions on the part of the enemies will continually add excitement to the game play.
