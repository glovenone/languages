A strong narrative runs through it, nothing is as it seems and as the mysticism and nightmares pile up the reward is a glimpse through a window into a weird and wonderful world.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun“Echo of the Wilds is gorgeous, a beautifully crafted survival sim with an expansive narrative and unique style. The story will appeal to those who like cryptic psychological tales and the writing is another strong point, a contrast of epic and unconventional that's entertaining, effective, and adds a lot of humor.”GM News Bite												关于这款游戏							Echo of the Wilds is a puzzly narrativy adventure, featuring randomised wilderness survival.Finding yourself in mysterious forests you must unfurl a spiritual tale of solace before the unending winter consumes all.
