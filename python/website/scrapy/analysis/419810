We can’t wait for the next one.”CNET“All the other hallmarks of the Tin Man treatment are also to be found in House of Hell, including an atmospheric soundtrack, good use of multimedia and smooth and easy usability.”4/5 – Gamezebo“Old fans will love the nostalgia, and those who have never played this sort of thing before are in for a treat.”9/10 – Starburst												关于这款游戏							Taking refuge in the infamous House of Hell has to be the worst mistake of your life!
