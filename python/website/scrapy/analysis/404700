So congratulations cousin and congratulations to the others as well 👌👌😀😁”5/5 – Developer's 10 year old cousin“Easy to Grasp. Hard to Master. Within 10 seconds I had figured out how to play the game. 30 seconds later I was yelling at myself for not being able to do it right. This is the kind of challenge I like. Where I feel like I'm at fault and not the game.”4/5 – Jacob Tapp, on the Android version“White Snake: Fa Hai, you do not know love”Xiao Meng, on a Chinese website that stole our game (Google translated)													Community levels									Find new levels made by the community or share your own!																						关于这款游戏							Single-button controls that are easy to learn, but hard to masterQuick, bite-sized sessions.
