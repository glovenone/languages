desc_long							评测						“Strip away all the punkish ingenuity piled on Nuclear Throne and you're left with this: a skin-fidgeting, hair-tingling battle of textures. Hard meets sticky. Bang meets squelch.”Eurogamer“It’s an anarchic thrash of a roguelike where everything goes boom or splat—or, more frequently, boom and splat.”PC Gamer“It’s a rapid-fire, deliciously crunchy randomized romp starring a cavalcade of characters from Vlambeer’s past.”Rock, Paper, Shotgun												关于这款游戏							Nuclear Throne is a post-apocalyptic roguelike-like top-down shooter. Not 'the final hope of humanity' post-apocalyptic, but 'humanity is extinct and mutants and monsters now roam the world' post-apocalyptic. Fight your way through the wastelands with powerful weaponry, collecting radiation to mutate some new limbs and abilities. All these things and more you could do if only you were good at this game. Can you reach the Nuclear Throne?
