desc_long							评测						“Easy to pick up, fun to play, and funny: three big pluses for any game.”Train Wreck Gaming												关于这款游戏							You want to hear a joke? Universal peace. I mean, why settle for serenity when you can unleash an arsenal of high-powered warheads and destroy every planet in the universe? Take that, faraway civilizations!Destructamundo is a game of chain reactions and massive explosions. Set off a warhead and watch the fireworks as you cause as much widespread damage as possible by setting off long, winding combos that reach throughout the cosmos. Destroy an entire planetary system in a single shot (or, if you’re not so cunning, destroy it in a couple of shots). Why would you do such a horrible thing, you might ask? For shiny gold medals, of course! Well, that and the survival of your species, but that’s decidedly less important.Not enough info for you? Check out these BULLET POINTS:Easy single-click gameplay for short bursts of playtime or long sessions of stellar extermination!Awesome power-ups that make your quest for universal destruction all the more satisfying!72 levels set across three different parsecs!Rad space-related terminology like “parsecs”!
