desc_long								关于这款游戏							As an apprentice magician and alchemist, you learn from different alchemy masters. They teach you to mix elixirs, create potions and control them on alchemist table. Prove everyone that you are a born alchemist! Key features: - 60 levels of varying difficulty in 5 scenarios; - realistic fluid animation and physics; - challenging puzzles; - fancy hand-drawn graphics P.S. This game was initially designed for devices with accelerometer but for PC we decided to add WASD and arrow controls, that made the game even more difficult and entertaining!
