desc_long								关于这款游戏							Inspired by games like Fez, Braid, and Ghosts and Goblins, Camera Obscura takes you on a quest to the top of an ancient tower in a forgotten land.  You are a lone photographer on a desperate search. You’ll attempt to summit a ruined tower – a relic of a fanatical sect trying to reach the sun. Face off against dangerous animals, crumbling architecture, and perilous pitfalls.Camera Obscura takes the beloved platforming gameplay from the 80’s and 90’s and adds an innovative "afterimage" mechanic that allows you to clone the world around you in order to span gaps, create staircases, and freeze moving platforms in place. As you climb the tower’s 57 stories, you’ll also use this power to crush deadly monsters between real world objects and the ones you’ve cloned yourself.Key FeaturesCustom level editor. Make your own levels with the included editor, play them, share them with friends! No programming required, just point and click to create platforms, enemies, switches, and doors. Share packs of levels on the Steam Workshop! Original soundtrack. Listen to 11 beautifully-composed tracksMultiple language support, achievements, multiple endings, and more![/list]
