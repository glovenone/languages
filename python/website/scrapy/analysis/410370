[...] Focus on spinning the ship around and let the magic happen on its own.”4/5 – http://indiegamereviewer.com/review-huenison-a-fast-paced-shooter-for-commodore-64-enthusiasts/“It's a very unusual experience that quickly hooks you with its subtleties and intensity.”N/A – http://jayisgames.com/review/huenison.php“Now, besides looking fantastic and playing a terrifyingly addictive game, Huenison comes for both Windows and Amiga OS (!) PCs, and I frankly cannot recommend it enough.”N/A – http://indiegames.com/2013/07/the_great_genre_blender_huenis.html												关于这款游戏							Huenison is an innovative puzzle-shooter that takes various elements from Arkanoid, BOH, Decathlon, Dyna Blaster, Impossible Mission, Oil's Well, Pac-Man, Pang, Qix, Slam Tilt, Space Invaders, Tetris and Vital Light, and puts them together in a hectic arcade mix. All in retro visuals and synthetic sonorities that recall the revered Commodore 64's SID chip.You shoot at falling bricks with a cannon at the bottom of a well (and no, you haven't ever seen anything like this before). Your beams hit bricks only when they are of the same color. Hitting a brick produces a specific effect depending on the type of the brick. Missing bricks will let them accumulate at the bottom of the well, raising the ground where the cannon rests - and, on top of that, bringing the deadly zapper down, closer to the cannon.But this is just the beginning: each level plays differently, more and more brick types are introduced along the way, occasional disturbances will suddenly bring some more chaos, and lots of bonuses will help catch a breath (and score more points)!It's a unique experience that can't be described with words. Just dive into Huenison's Mind Control Wells, defeat him, and save the world!immediate hectic addictive gameplay · 25 levels · 9 game modes · huge variety of bricks and bonuses · C64-style music, speech and sounds · many cool graphic modes · online hiscores · exciting prog-SID OST
