Dark Ages has such demanding graphics and animation that it requires an 80286 (or 80386) machine to run at proper speed, otherwise it may run too slowly. (NOTE: Dark Ages runs too fast on 486 or higher computers. You will need to slow them down to play).

Garth sent you away from the Great Kingdom to be raised as a peasant, and to never fulfill your destiny as the future King. But Garth made a terrible mistake.
