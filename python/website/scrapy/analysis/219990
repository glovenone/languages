More so than Torchlight 2, which was a bit too much of a sugar rush experience for me, and certainly more so than Diablo III”N/A – Rock Paper Shotgun												关于这款游戏							Enter an apocalyptic fantasy world where humanity is on the brink of extinction, iron is valued above gold and trust is hard earned.
